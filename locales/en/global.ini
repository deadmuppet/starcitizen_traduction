BrightSky_Desc=The CDF has partnered with Anvil Aerospace to find the most capable operatives in the system. \n\nIf you find one of these Platinum certifications, you can redeem the ticket at a ship kiosk at New Deal, Astro Armada or Crusader Showroom for a free F8C. \n\nThe catch is that your identity and location has been shared with participants throughout the system. For everyone else, if you can stop the ticketholder before they get to the kiosk, you can claim the ticket for your own.\n\nWhoever makes it will not only receive this next generation superiority fighter, but also prove that they have what it takes for the toughest CDF assignments.\n\nGood luck.

BrightSky_Hunter_Desc=In an effort to identify the most capable operatives, the CDF have partnered with Anvil Aerospace to give away a handful of F8C Superiority Fighters to anyone who can successfully turn in a platinum certification ticket. \n\nOne of these tickets has just been found by ~mission(PlayerThatFound). They will be attempting to turn it into an eligible ship kiosk at New Deal, Astro Armada, or the Crusader Showroom. Should you accept, you are charged with trying to stop them. If you obtain the ticket yourself and can get to the kiosk, the ship can be yours, but understand that you will be the hunted now.\n\nGood luck.
