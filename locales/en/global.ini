As long as you kill ~mission(TargetName), I will be more than satisfied.\n\nRespectfully,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_VH_desc_002=I just got off of a comm with a client who felt obligated to monologue about why he needed a target dead.  \n\nI will spare you the details, but know that the assignment's name is ~mission(TargetName). They are a relatively high profile individual and will be traveling near ~mission(Location|Address) in a heavily guarded ship with highly qualified escorts.\n\nI suspect there will most likely be a full defensive reaction to any hostile actions so be prepared.\n\nRespectfully,\nVaughn
vaughn_assassination_VH_desc_003=Believe it or not, but this assignment's name is near identical to one of my earliest contracts. I can't tell if that's because it's a popular name or if it reflects on my having been in the business a very long time.\n\nThat said, this ~mission(TargetName) is very different than the earlier one I dealt with. This one is traveling near ~mission(Location|Address) in a heavily fortified ship with well armed guards escorting them. \n\nIf I am not mistaken, they are going to put up quite the resistance, but hopefully this ~mission(TargetName) will soon be as dead as the first.\n\nRespectfully,\nVaughn\n
vaughn_assassination_VH_desc_intro=I will not skirt the truth of it. This will be my second attempt at dispatching ~mission(TargetName). The first time cost me a very talented asset.\n\nIt turns out that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is not only a skilled combatant themselves, but they travel with several highly skilled companions making them most difficult to kill. I have traced their current whereabouts to ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nWhile I would hate to see the same unfortunate fate befall you, I believe that you shall triumph where others failed.\n\nI sincerely hope you prove me right.\n\nRespectfully,\nVaughn
