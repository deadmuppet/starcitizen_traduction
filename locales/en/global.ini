PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_CheckpointTaken_NearTie_IG_002,P=Ooo, we got ourselves a real competition today. Don't know who's gonna snatch the prize.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_CheckpointTaken_NearTie_IG_003,P=I tell you what. This is it right here. This is the kind of race you dream about. Whoever wins is really earning their keep, today.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_CheckpointTaken_NearVictory_IG_001,P=Getting close here. A little longer and it's gonna be all over. Question is, the rest of you just gonna let 'em win?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_CheckpointTaken_NearVictory_IG_002,P=This could be it. We could be looking at a winner here. That is of course unless someone steps up and stops 'em.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_EncourageLosingRacer_IG_001,P=This race isn't over yet. Doesn't matter what place you are right now. One lucky break or stupid mistake and this race is up for grabs, so stay in it.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_EncourageLosingRacer_IG_002,P=Now, if you're thinking about giving up hope just cause you're losing right now, let me remind you, the only thing separating you from victory is a handful of well-placed missiles. Think on it.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_EncourageLosingRacer_IG_003,P=As much as I love watching a skilled pilot win, I love a good underdog story even more. So know that even though you might be at the back of the pack right now, I'm pulling for you.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_EncourageLosingRacer_IG_004,P=You may not be winning this thing, but that don't mean you should go out quiet. Hell, if you're gonna lose, you might as well go down swinging, right?

PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IntenseCombat_IG_001,P=This race is turning into a real shooting gallery. Is there a sale on ammo or something?

PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_GenCommentary_IntenseCombat_IG_003,P=Now, I'm not one to judge, but it feels like there are a lot of aggression issues being worked out right now.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_NonRacersInterrupt_IG_001,P=Okay... looks like we got some assholes crashing our race.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_NonRacersInterrupt_IG_002,P=Seems we've got some uninvited guests screwing up our race.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_NonRacersInterrupt_IG_003,P=Heads up racers, looks like some blinders have decided to use you for target practice.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_OneRacerLeft_IG_001,P=Well, if I'm doing my math right, there's only one pilot left. So as long as they don't blow themselves up, the race is theirs.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_OneRacerLeft_IG_002,P=With only one survivor left, the finish is theirs for the taking. Piece of advice, don't get cocky. I've seen some crazy shit happen when people drop their guard.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_OneRacerLeft_IG_003,P=All right, we got good news and bad news. Good news for our last remaining pilot, you're all that's left, so you pretty much won. Bad news for everyone else who enjoys exciting races because... well see the good news. Someone wake me when they finish.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_Blowout_IG_001,P=This is getting to be a blowout. They are just dominating.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearTie_IG_002,P=Ooo, we got ourselves a real competition today. Don't know who's gonna snatch the prize.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearTie_IG_003,P=I tell you what. This is it right here. This is the kind of race you dream about. Whoever wins is really earning their keep, today.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearVictory_IG_001,P=Getting close here. A little longer and it's gonna be all over. Question is, the rest of you just gonna let 'em win?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearVictory_IG_002,P=This could be it. We could be looking at a winner here. That is of course unless someone steps up and stops 'em.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Progression_NearVictory_IG_003,P=We headin' into the final moments of the race. If you've been biding your time, now might be the time to make your move.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_First_IG_001,P=And our first racer is down. Was just a matter of time until things got real.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_IG_003,P=Got another pilot merging with the infinite.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_IG_004,P=Another one down. We're getting into a downright brawl here.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_IG_005,P=Y'all see that fool go down? Damn they got lit up.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_Leader_IG_001,P=[ Laughing ] Oh, damn. I bet they thought they were gonna win.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_Leader_IG_002,P=Oh! They thought they were on top! That they were untouchable, but that dream came crashing down.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_Leader_IG_003,P=One second they're in the lead, and the next they're a flaming wreck. That's life for ya.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_NewLeaderKillsLeader_IG_001,P=Kill the leader, become the leader. There can be only one!
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_NewLeaderKillsLeader_IG_002,P=Cycle of life here, people. It's all about killing your way to the top.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerDies_NewLeaderKillsLeader_IG_003,P=Not only did that racer just kill their way into first place, but they did it with serious style.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_001,P=Um... a pilot just left in the middle of the race. What's the point of starting something you ain't gonna finish?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_002,P=One of our racers just up and quit... That's a bit dissapointing.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_003,P=Seems one of our pilots ran away. Hope no one was betting on them.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_RacerLeaves_IG_004,P=Did y'all see that pilot leave? Thought it went without saying, but don't leave in the middle of a race.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_First_IG_001,P=First checkpoint down. Let's see if they can make it two.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_First_IG_002,P=First one's down. We're off, people.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_IG_006,P=There we go. Give that pilot a point.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_NewLeader_IG_001,P=Looks like we got ourselves a new leader.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_NewLeader_IG_002,P=This ain't over yet. New leader's stepping up.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_NewLeader_IG_003,P=Hoowee, there's a new boss in town.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_SingleRacer_IG_001,P=And checkpoint. Not a real surprise there.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_SingleRacer_IG_002,P=(snore interrupted) Huh? What happened? Oh...
PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_Scramble_CheckpointTaken_SingleRacer_IG_003,P=One last racer, one more point.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_MidRace_WrongWay_IG_003,P=Not sure what "race enhancers" you're on, but you're flying the wrong direction.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WinnerDeclared_Low_IG_003,P=That'll do it. Helluva show from our winner... probably too good of one if you ask me. But nice work.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_001,P=I'll see you next time, ladies and germs. Remember, keep the throttle down and your eyes open. Now, if you'll excuse me, there's a bottle of Rust with my name on it.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_002,P=Like to thank everyone listening. Keep at it and maybe next time it'll be you in the winner's circle. This is Nas Calloway signing off. Now if you'll excuse me. I gotta take a leak. Later.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_003,P=Whew! Don't know about you but I am wiped. Before I head out, a shout out to our new champ and a big thanks to everyone else for making them look so damn good. This is Nas Calloway. I'll see y'all at the next one.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_004,P=That's it for me. Win or lose, hope you all had as much fun as I did. Though I'm guessing it's a lot more fun if you win. If you come back and race again, maybe you'll get to find out for yourself. 'Til then, keep it tight.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PostRace_WrapUp_IG_005,P=Let me be the first to say congrats to our victor. And to all the others, hopefully, I'll see you all back here again real soon. It's been a trip.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_EntrantLeaves_IG_001,P=Seems one of our racers had a change of heart and ghosted. But hey, there's always other fish in the sea, right?
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_EntrantLeaves_IG_002,P=Well, we're down a entrant now. Guess some people can't handle the pressure. Screw it. Race's probably better off without 'em, anyway.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_MinRacersAccepted_IG_001,P=What's up, people. Looks like we got enough racers to make this official. Now we just need people to show up and we can get this show on the road.

PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_RaceCanceled_IG_001,P=That's it. I'm calling it. Race is canceled. No point in doing this if no one else is coming. Maybe next time.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_RaceCanceled_IG_002,P=Alright, look. I hate to do it, but I got a bunch of pilots who bailed, so it looks like we're gonna have to race some other time.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_StartEarly_IG_001,P=Actually, I might kick this off a little early.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_StartEarly_IG_002,P=I'll be honest, I'm kinda eager to get this show on the road.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_StartEarly_IG_003,P=It's looking like we might be all set to go. Just gonna do a last count...
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_WaitLonger_IG_001,P=Stay frosty, y'all. Shouldn't be too much longer now.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_WaitLonger_IG_002,P=Just a couple more ticks, and we'll be ready to go.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_WaitLonger_IG_003,P=I know y'all wanna get this poppin' but it's gonna be a little bit longer.
PU_RACEANN1_AN_PreRace_Welcome_LongWait_IG_001,P=Welcome, welcome. We're still waiting on a few more stragglers, so hang out for a sec. We'll get going soon.

PU_RUTO_MG_Mission_Greetings_Imperator_IG_002_HeyIWas=Hey, I was just thinking, if I comm'd a general or someone looking like this, do you think I could get them to bomb someone for me?

PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DataRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_AllRightSo=All right, so here's the deal. Got word that a facility is gonna be getting timed intelligence drops from their mainframe. You get ahold of these parcels, you can offload them to any number of infoagents in the area. Just watch your back though, you aren't the only person who's been interested in this.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DataRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ItsRutoThanks=It's Ruto. Thanks for the payment. I sent the details to your mobi, but the more you know, right? Anyway, location I sent you is the site of timed data drops. If you secure the server and get ahold of this intel, you can sell it off. The more you get, the more you can make. I know other fixers are selling this tip, so expect company.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DataRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. So here's the deal, the location I sent you is a server that's scheduled to start doing timed data drops. Now, I'm told that the site will be empty until much later, so you've got plenty of time to get in there and secure as many of these drops as you can. Just keep an eye out, you're not the only person I sold this info to.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereGot=Hey there. Got your payment. I sent you the details but here's the deal, a runner I know confided in me before he ran out of breath about a production lab that's set to start processing some drugs. The thing's fully automated and left alone, so anything that comes out's ripe for the taking. Now, I'm not sure how many other people may know about this, so you'll need to move quick and grab what you can.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ThanksForThe=Thanks for the creds, so I'm gonna deliver on my end. Got word that a drug lab's gonna start spitting out packages and there's no one there to watch it which pretty much sounds like a free-for-all to me. You got the location so have at it. Whatever you can get out of there with is yours. You can burn it, sell it, dump it into the sun for all I care.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_IJustSent=I just sent you the location of a drug lab that's about to turn into a goldmine. Whoever runs the place just started production on a slew of drug packages and left the place unguarded. I'm not gonna lie, it'll probably be a bloodbath, but you can offload whatever drugs you manage to score. Have fun.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. Looks like Crusader found the main Nine Tails fleet. I need you to go and keep those security and mercs off them until the Nine Tails finish up whatever the hell it is they're doing.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_WhyHelloThere=Why hello there. Ruto here. So here's the deal, Crusader ended up cracking the location of the Nine Tails fleet. They still have some shit they're trying to do, so I need you to tie up those Cru Sec pukes and their mercenary flunkies for as long as possible until the Nine Tails finish up.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_WhatsUpKiller=What's up, killer. It's Ruto. Thanks for lending a hand. In case you're totally in the dark, and don't read your contracts, Crusader Security have dispatched a bunch of mercs to where the Nine Tails are broadcasting their quantum dampening field from. I need you to hold them off until the Nine Tails finish up whatever the hell it is they're doing and get out of there.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. So here's the deal, Nine Tails is currently running their little quantum blockade thing which is causing all sorts of chaos for me. You see, Crusader's sending out scanning ships to try and find Nine Tails, but they're getting uncomfortably close to uncovering my operations. In short, I want you to track down the Crusader scanning ships and take them out.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereNine=Ruto here. Nine Tails are desperate to keep this quantum blockade up for a while longer. Crusader's sent in a bunch of scanning ships to flush them out, but I'm a little worried they're gonna blow up some of my spots, so I'm gonna need you to stop that. Take out as many scanning ships as you can.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HiThereIts=Hi there. It's Ruto. So here's the deal, Crusader scanning ships are out there trying to blow up the Nine Tails' little quantum blockade, but unfortunately they might stumble across some of my operations. That, I can't have, so get in there and take out as many of them as you can. Have fun, tiger.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_MedRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyRutoHere=Hey, Ruto here. So I got word that a medlab's going to be producing some packages of medicine at regular intervals for a limited time. If you can secure the area, grab whatever packages you can, and get out, then you can sell it any number of places. Watch out though. From what I gather, this isn't exactly classified information.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_MedRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ItsRutoGot=It's Ruto. Got your payment, so I figured I'd give you the platinum service. Here's the deal, contact of mine said a production facility's going to be churning out some medicine. You should watch out though. With a premium on this kind of medicine, you can be sure that other people will be trying to boost it.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_MedRaid_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. So here's the deal, the data I sent you is the location of an automated production facility that's about to start churning out batches of medicine. You get there and secure it, all the batches that come out are yours for the taking. I've been hearing rumbles that this isn't exactly proprietary knowledge, so expect some company.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_WhyHelloThere=Why, hello there. I sent the details to your mobi, but here's the jist. That location's gonna temporarily turn into a hotspot. If you get in and get out, there's real money to be made, just watch your back in there.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereGot=Ruto here. Got your payment. Everything you need to know is in the message I sent you. You've only got a limited time to get there and secure the site before there isn't anything left to steal, but understand, you'll probably have some competition, so good luck.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_ItsRutoGot=It's Ruto. Got your credits. You should have all the details, but figured I'd give you a head's up. This is only going to last for a little while, so make sure you head out sooner rather than later. Just got word that some other fixers have been selling this info, so you'll probably have some company.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_ItsRutoYou=It's Ruto. You should have all the info you need to get going. Just wanted to let you know about a couple things: a) whatever you're able to steal, there are people out there looking to buy. B) This is only going to last for a little while. Lastly, you're probably gonna have some competition out there, so make sure you're armed.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_HeyThereRuto=Hey there. Ruto here. I sent you all the intel to knock out this job, but thought you should know. People have been selling info about this job to other operators, so you're most likely gonna have some company down there. I'd head down there sooner rather than later and secure the site. That bit of advice is free.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_BlackMarket_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyRutoHere=Hey, Ruto here. If you're looking for a spot to offload the stuff, I got word that a contact on the Black Market's paying primo creds for it. Something to consider.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_BlackMarket_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_WhatsUpIts=What's up. It's Ruto. Not sure if you've already got a buyer in mind, but if you don't, I happen to know someone on the black market who's paying a premium for any stuff you swipe. I'll send the details. That tip's on me.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_GrimHEX_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsMe=Hey, it's me again. Not sure if you've boosted anything yet, but I just got word that there's a very motivated buyer on Grim HEX who'll paying way over market value. That tip's free.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereKiller=Hey there, killer. FYI, I happen to know someone who's very eager to get their hands on any product from that site. It's your call, of course, I'm just a humble fixer, looking to establish meaningful financial relationships. You've got the details. Do with them what you will.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereJust=Ruto here. Just in case you manage to swipe some product without catching a bullet to the dome for your trouble, a contact of mine is willing to pay a premium for anything you can get out of there. I'll send you the data. Hit 'em up if you're interested.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Announce_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_SoListenIm=So listen? I'm not sure if you've already got a plan for any stuff you boost, but if you're looking, I have a contact who's paying top creds for the stuff. I'll send you the location details... this is Ruto, by the way.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveFail_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_YouReallyGotta=You really gotta finish what you start. Even letting one of those scan ships survive just means that Crusader's that much closer to finding the Nine Tails.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveFail_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereIll=Ruto here. I'll admit, I was a little bummed out you weren't able to take out all those Crusader ships. To be fair, they only learned more info about Nine Tails, not me, so I wasn't that bothered, but still? it's sad.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveFail_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_UhOhLooks=Uh oh. Looks like those scan ships were able to get more intel about the location of the Nine Tails fleet. Sucks for them?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveSuccess_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_RutoHereCan=Ruto here. Can I just say, it's awesome seeing your handiwork when you're on. Crusader's gonna have a helluva time trying to find the Nine Tails when all their ships are vented. Keep it up.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveSuccess_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_NiceJobBlasting=Nice job blasting all those scan ships. I'll be sure to let the Nine Tails know you're keeping Crusader off their tail. Or tails.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Chat_Comment_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_PrevObjectiveSuccess_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_IReallyLove=I really love this spirit of unlawful camaraderie. Even though I'm in the clear, here you are, waxing Crusader security pukes to help keep them off the Nine Tails. It's really? it's really something?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_RutoHereI=Ruto here. I just got word that my buyer closed up shop. Maybe next time, huh?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyBadNews=Hey, bad news. My buyer's not taking anymore merch.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_RutoHereJust=Ruto here. Just heard my buyer closed up shop so you might need to offload your merch somewhere else.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_NotTakePart_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_ItsRutoSo=It's Ruto. So that thing we talked about? Yeah, it's over, so you missed it. Next time maybe?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_NotTakePart_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. Seems like you lost interest in that little job I told you about, but the thing's over anyway. So? yeah? I guess you missed out.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_NotTakePart_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_ItsRutoWord=It's Ruto. Word is that the job I talked to you about earlier? Yeah, it's over. Maybe next time, huh? Oh, it probably goes without saying, but I don't do refunds.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsMe=Hey, it's me. Just got word that there aren't gonna be anymore drops. You can stick around if you want, but it'll just be for the fun of the kill.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereNot=Ruto here. Not sure if you're fighting anyone right now, but a contact said that the site isn't gonna be spitting out any more drops, so you might as well bail.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. Got a hit that there aren't gonna be any more drops from that site, so I'd get out of there and sell whatever you got.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyNineTails=Hey, Nine Tails are pulling out. Crusader and their mercs were causing too much damage. I'd lay low if I were you. They're pretty pissed.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ItsRutoLooks=It's Ruto. Looks like Crusader pushed out the Nine Tails. From what I hear, they're furious about losing their blockade. Anyway, expect things to get bloody.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. Nine Tails are pulling out of the area because of those security punks and their mercs. Apparently this whole blockade was a smokescreen for something else they were doing  and they didn't get to do it. Anyway, word just got back to me that they're fuming.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_RutoHereJust=Ruto here. Just got word that Crusader managed to lock down the location of the Nine Tails fleet, but in worse news, those assholes stumbled across one of my side hustles. Next time, when I tell you to blast scanning ships, you blast more scanning ships.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_WhatTheHell=What the hell? When I hire you, I expect you to do the job I hired you for. Now those Crusader security dipshits are all over the Nine Tails' fleet and messing up another one of my operations. Get your shit together? (Pause) This is Ruto.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_ItsRutoGotta=It's Ruto. Gotta say, I'm a little pissed you weren't able to take out those Crusader security idiots fast enough. Now a couple of my businesses have become little more public than I would like. They also figured out where the Nine Tails are broadcasting their quantum dampening from, so you basically screwed up on two fronts. Helluva job.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyLookWhen=Hey, look. When I said I need those scan ships destroyed, I didn't think I was being cryptic. Take this as a learning opportunity: get better. Or get lost.

PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyItsRuto=Hey, it's Ruto. I'm still trying to get my operations out of the line of fire, so stop letting those scan ships live. That is what I'm paying you for.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_YouGottaGet=You gotta get your head in gear and do the job I'm paying you to do. I need those scan ships dusted before they expose facets of my operation that I would prefer to remain hidden. That clear enough for you?
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Failed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_LetsTakeA=Let's take a moment and recognize that you are not holding up your end of the bargain here.

PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereIts=Hey there. It's Ruto. Just heard you made some creds. Glad to see we could work something out.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereMy=Ruto here. My contact said you just dropped by and sold some stuff. I'm not expecting a tip, but you know? a little courtesy goes a long way.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Buyer_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_ItsRutoMy=It's Ruto. My buyer was real pleased with the merch your dropped off. Keep it up.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereChamp=Hey there, champ. Nine Tails finished whatever it is they were doing. Nice job keeping those Crusader hacks off their back.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HiyaItsRuto=Hiya. It's Ruto. Looks like Nine Tails are pulling out of the system. They're jazzed, so I guess their quantum blockade must have been a success. Score one for the good guys.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_WhosMyFavorite=Who's my favorite operator? Helluva job protecting that Nine Tails fleet. They took care of everything they needed to do and Crusader are left looking like a bunch of dopes. So a good day for everyone.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyRutoHere=Hey, Ruto here. Got some good news and bad news. Bad news is that those scanning ships seem to have found the Nine Tails fleet. Good news is you did a helluva job keeping Crusader off my back. So that's cool. Thanks.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_ItsRutoMiss=It's Ruto. Miss me? Anyway, you did a great job distracting Crusader long enough for me to shuffle some of my operations around. So good job. Unfortunately, they also found the Nine Tails which is less cool, but hey, shit happens. Later.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Mission_FleetFind_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_YouCopyIts=You copy? It's Ruto. Thanks for taking out those Crusader ships. I was able to make some moves to keep them from finding out some of my less hidden operations. On the flip side, I guess they dug out the location of the Nine Tails fleet, so that sucks?for them.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aPlayer_tEnemy_FromAlly_IG_001_RutoAgainHelluva=Ruto again. Helluva job burning those Crusader ships. Keep an eye out in case any more scanning ships show up.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aPlayer_tEnemy_FromAlly_IG_002_HiyaImBack=Hiya. I'm back. Heard you dusted a handful of those Cru Sec ships. I appreciate it.

PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aPlayer_tEnemy_FromAlly_IG_003_RutoHereJust=Ruto here. Just wanted to say you did a bang-up job dusting those security pukes. Make sure you do the same if Crusader sends out some replacements. Keeping them off of Nine Tails also keeps them off of me, which is pretty great. Later.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aPlayer_tEnemy_FromAlly_IG_004_RutoHereThanks=Ruto here. Thanks for wrecking those scan ships. Should definitely give me a little more time to make some moves. You should stick around in case any more show up or hunt down more of them. Both would be great. Later.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_DestroyScanShips_aPlayer_tEnemy_FromAlly_IG_005_HeyThereIts=Hey there. It's Ruto again. I like what you did to those Crusader security ships. Very efficient. Gonna help me loads to keep the law away from my little operation. I'm sure the Nine Tails will be thrilled too. Feel free to keep hunting down any more scan ships. Ruto out.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_EvadeDetection_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereIts=Hey there. It's Ruto. Just wanted to let you know, I made some moves, reshuffled some hustles, and got my business squared away. By all means, feel free to keep wiping out Crusader scan ships. I'm sure the Nine Tails would appreciate the help.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_EvadeDetection_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoAgainThanks=Ruto again. Thanks for holding off those Crusader dopes. My shit is now officially in order, so we're good. If you wanna keep blasting them, and who doesn't, keep doing what you're doing. Nine Tails still got their thing going on, so I'm sure they'll be all for it.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Succeed_Objective_FleetFind_EvadeDetection_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_MyHeroGreat=My hero. Great job distracting those Crusader ships long enough for me to reshuffle my operations. They can scan all they want now and they won't find anything. Of mine, at least. But hey, if you wanna keep killing scan ships, I'm sure the Nine Tails will dig it.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Warn_Buyer_Expiring_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HopeYoureEn=Hope you're en route to my buyer to offload that merch. I just got word that they aren't gonna be buying for too much longer.

PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Warn_Mission_Expiring_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_RutoHereThat=Ruto here. That little job I talked to you about? It's almost over, so I'd head that way sooner rather than later if you're looking to get involved.
PU_RUTO_M_DEH_Warn_Mission_Expiring_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyThereRuto=Hey there. Ruto here. Just got word that the job I sent you is gonna end soon. Might want to hustle if you're still interested. Doesn't matter to me, I'm already paid.

PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_PlayerExitShipComment_IG_003_ImJustGonna=I'm just gonna say it. You two look good together.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_PlayerExitShipComment_IG_004_HardToSay=Hard to say what's better, right? That great exterior, or that real sharp interior.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_PlayerExitShipComment_IG_005_YouCanReally=You can really see the quality once you get inside.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Beautiful_IG_001_IKnowWhat=I know what you're thinking. How can a ship that looks that gorgeous cost so little? To be honest, I can't believe it myself.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Beautiful_IG_002_ThoseLinesThe=Those lines, the styling. Even sitting still she looks like she's flying. A real beauty.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Fast_IG_001_IfYouWanna=If you wanna talk fast, this speedster can hold her own. The throttle pretty much accelerates by itself.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Fast_IG_002_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking for speed, then you're looking in the right place. You should hear this baby purr when she gets going.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_GreatDeal_IG_001_AsGoodAs=As good as this ship is, it's hard to believe it's this cheap. But hey, if that's what the price says, that's what the price says.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_GreatDeal_IG_002_DependingOnWhich=Depending on which way you want to go, this ship is probably one of the best deals on the floor. Great condition. Great price.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_HardWorking_IG_001_WhatsGreatAbout=What's great about this one here is that it works just as hard as you do if not harder.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_HardWorking_IG_002_IfYouWant=If you want a ship that is going to be there day in, day out, taking what ever you throw at it, then this right here might be the ship you want.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_001_YouGotA=You got a good eye. That's some quality craftsmanship right there. They don't make 'em like this any more, I can tell you that.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_002_YouKnowI=You know, I shouldn't say this, but this right here might be my favorite in the whole place. Not that anything we sell isn't fantastic, but I don't know... there's just something special about her. You feel it, right?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_003_OkayPictureThis=Okay, picture this, you're traveling to see that special someone. What are you riding in, some random old junker? Or are you cruising along in a top of the line genuine certified pre-owned beauty like this one here?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_004_WeGetA=We get a lot of different vehicles coming and going, but every once in a while we get something in like this one here that really catches my eye.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_005_YouCanTalk=You can talk specs and figures all day, but sometimes when you look at a ship, you just know its right for you. I say trust that gut.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Safe_IG_001_PersonallyWhatI=Personally, what I look for in a ship, is something that can get me where I'm going safe and sound in one piece. That's gonna be this ship right here.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Safe_IG_002_TheySayYou=They say you can't put a price on safety. I say bullshit. Not only did we put a price on it, we put a great price on it. Protection per credit, you're not gonna find much better than this.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Strorage_IG_001_IDontKnow=I don't know about you, but I can always use some more storage room. That's why this ship is perfect. Plenty of SCU and then some.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Strorage_IG_002_IfStorageIs=If storage is important to you, then you should do yourself a favor and spend some time with this ship. I think you'll be happy with what you see.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_100Series_IG_001_YouKnowA=Not only is the 300 a pleasure to fly, when you're not flying her, she's a real pleasure to look at. I know I wouldn't kick her out of my hangar.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_300Series_IG_001_YouKnowThe=Promise me one thing, if you wind up getting the 600, you're gonna invite me to one of your parties cause everybody knows that the best parties in the verse are 600 parties.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_600Series_IG_001_PromiseMeOne=I'll be honest, I wasn't quite sure what to make of the 85x at first. But now that I've spent some time with her, she's really grown on me. It's got all of origin's attention to detail streamlined down to a smaller package.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_85X_IG_001_IllBeHonest=You know a lot of the younger people who come in here are interested in the 100. And I mean, why not? Origin comfort wrapped up in a sporty, fun chasis. I see the appeal myself.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_890Jump_IG_001_LookIllBe=Look. I'll be blunt. There's a swimming pool. If that doesn't convince you on the 890, I'm not sure what else will.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_ArgoMPUV_IG_001_TheArgoMpuv=The Argo MPUV is a great little workhorse. Functional to a fault.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Arrow_IG_001_IveTalkedTo=I've talked to some of the ex-Navy who come in here about the Arrow. Well, to tell the truth, it's more like they talk to me about it. Can't say enough good things. Seems the light fighter makes one hell of a scout ship. Not many serving who haven't had their butt saved by one of these guys.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Aurora_IG_001_ConsideringAnAurora=Considering an Aurora, huh? I like that. People are so eager to over complicate things that they forget that basic doesn't mean bad. The Aurora flies and gets you where you're going. Sounds like the perfect ship to me.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Avenger_IG_001_TheresAReason=There's a reason the Advocacy's been counting on Avengers for so long. Few ships can match its operational flexibility. The thing's an icon.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Blade_IG_001_ShesAKiller=She's a killer, isn't she? It's like the Vanduul took a Scythe and shaved it down till all that was left was the bite.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Buccaneer_IG_001_TheBuccsA=The Bucc's a great little fighter. You toss one into any scrap and suddenly its a whole new game. Cutlass coming at you, you can handle it. Cutlass and a Bucc, forget about it.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Carrack_IG_001_ICouldPretty=I could pretty much talk all day about the Carrack, but I'm not gonna do that. I'm gonna let the ship speak for itself.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Caterpillar_IG_001_CaterpillarsGotA=Caterpillar's got a ton of storage, and Drake was thoughtful enough to give it few ways to protect it. Plus, I always get a weird thrill when a ship looks like its name.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Constellation_IG_001_EveryoneLovesTo=Everyone loves to argue which Connie is the best, but that's like arguing what amount of free money is the best. What I'm trying to say is that they're such a fantastic ship, you really can't go wrong with whichever one you fly.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Crucible_IG_001_TheCrucibleIs=The Crucible is some pretty incredible engineering. Thing is basically a flying toolbox. They can fix up most problems a pilot can run into. If that's not a great skill to have, don't know what is.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cutlass_IG_001_SolidOffenseDecent=Solid offense, decent defense, not too shabby of a hold, easy to take care of, and an interesting reputation to say the least. A lot of people think the Cutlass is a great investment, and I'm tempted to agree.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cyclone_IG_001_TheNewTumbril=The new Tumbril really outdid themselves with the Cyclone. I had an old homesteader in just the other week telling me that she had been riding in one of the originals for decades, and didn't once think about giving it up until she saw the new ones. Not only did she buy the new one, but she told me that she's gonna keep the old one on her porch just to sit in. How about that?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Dragonfly_IG_001_TheDragonflyIs=The Dragonfly is less of a ship and more of a lifestyle.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Eclipse_IG_001_OhIsThere=Oh, is there an Eclipse here? Thing's so stealthy I almost didn't notice it. Just kidding with ya. But seriously, thing's as silent of a predator as they come.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Endeavor_IG_001_TheEndeavorIs=The Endeavor is less of a ship and more of a roaming university. It's all a little bit beyond me, if I'm being honest, but I have it on good authority that if you're in the market for a scientific vessel, this is the one you want.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_F8Lightning_IG_001_ILoveThat=I love that we have an F8 for sale. I remember when these monsters were for the military only. Just look at the thing. Is that a killer or what? Let's see someone try to mess with you when you're flying one of these.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Freelancer_IG_001_IThinkOver=I think over the years, I've sold more Freelancers than just about anything else. I think it's cause MISC made them real jack of all trades. Plus, they really hold on to their resale value.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Genesis_IG_001_JustBetweenMe=Just between me and you, I've always wanted to own a Genesis. I flew on one with my dad when I was ten. We were going to visit my grandmother, and I don't think I had ever been on a ship that big or fancy before. Since then, there's always been a part of me that wonders what it would be like to be a commercial transport pilot. But maybe you buy this one, and then you can come back and tell me what it's like.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladiator_IG_001_TheGladiIs=The Gladi is a fascinting bit of hardware. For being so streamlined, it carries some serious ordnance. Almost like a light heavy.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladius_IG_001_GladiusIsFast=Gladius is fast, it's maneuverable, and as all the old timers say, it definitely punches above its weight class.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Glaive_IG_001_PeopleAreAlways=People are always eager to point out that a Glaive is just a Scythe with two blades, but it is so much more than that. You know the Vanduul clans only let the most dangerous and experienced pilots fly a Glaive?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hammerhead_IG_001_YouKnowWhat=You know what I've always wondered about the Hammerhead? Do you think they came up with the name first and made the ship match, or the other way around? Either way, it's one of the best patrol ships flying today.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hawk_IG_001_TheHawkIs=The Hawk is what I recommend to any bounty hunter who comes in. It's got the speed you need to run someone down, and guns to spare once you catch up with them.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Herald_IG_001_TheHeraldIs=The Herald is definitely one of the more interesting ships we have on the lot. It's not every data runner that comes with its own broadcast array.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_HerculesStarlifter_IG_001_TheHerculesPerforms=The Hercules performs as advertised. Its got the power needed to haul vehicles wherever, whenever. No easy feat.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hornet_IG_001_YouKnowCal=You know, Cal Mason of Squadron 42 flies a Hornet. If anyone knows about fighters, it's that guy.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_HullLine_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking for a hauler, you can't go wrong with a Hull. They were built to handle cargo, and damn if they don't do a good job of it.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hurricane_IG_001_YouKnowIn=You know in Sataball when you sail one to a teammate and they just tap it in, no problem? The Hurricane is the ship version of that. One of you is flying, the other is on the turret, and together you are just taking care of business.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Idris_IG_001_IfYoureActually=If you're actually in the market for something of this size and power, the Idris is a class all its own. She may not be cheap, but would you trust a cheap frigate?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_KhartuAl_IG_001_TheKhartuStands=The Khartu stands out for a lot of reasons, but those crazy Xi'an stairs alone make it a must buy.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Kraken_IG_001_TheKrakenFollows=The Kraken follows Drake's mantra of why do one thing well when you could do fifty. I've heard of them being used as mini carriers for militias. I've heard of them being used as mobile shopping plazas. Heck, I even heard of one guy who turned the whole thing into some sort of crazy night club. Not that I'm recommending that last one.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_M50_IG_001_IfIHad=If I had it my way, I would be out there flying this bad boy myself. I mean look at those thrusters. The M50 is just begging to be flown.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Mercury_IG_001_YouKnowWhats=You know what's funny about the Mercury? I get people wanting to buy it who don't even want to do data running. They just like the way it looks. Hats off to the Crusader designers on that one.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Mustang_IG_001_YouRememberThe=You remember the Mustang commercial? Where risk meets reward? Well, Consolidated took all the risk, and we get all the reward of being able to fly them. Bottom line is that they are just a fun ship to fly.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Nova_IG_001_WhatABeast=What a beast, right? You think about the war history on these Nova tanks, and it's amazing that you can just walk into a shop these days and buy one yourself. I mean, I used to play with a little toy Nova when I was a kid, and now I get to sell them.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Nox_IG_001_ApparantlyAopoaHad=Apparantly, Aopoa had to modify the Nox for Humans. I guess when Xi'an pilot them, they're bodies naturally enhance the aerodynamics. Our weird Human bodies threw everything out of whack, so they had to reconfigure a lot of things to get it just right for us.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Orion_IG_001_CanYouBelieve=Can you believe that the Orion is a ship that actually flies, and not just some kind of mining station? I mean look at the size of the thing.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_P52Merlin_IG_001_TheP52Is=The P-52 is a great little scrapper to have around to help in a fight. Nimble. Smaller frame which means its harder to hit. And it's easy on the eyes which never hurts.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_P72Archimedes_IG_001_TheArchimedesIs=The Archimedes is the Merlin's more sophisticated sibling. Everything that makes the P-52 so great but a little bit extra sprinkled on top. Definitely would not be out of place if you take it out to the track.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_PTVBuggy_IG_001_ThisLittleBuggy=This little buggy is great for getting around crowded areas like hangars or for short trips around the city.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Pioneer_IG_001_DidYouWatch=Did you watch when Silas Koerner introduced these back at the '47 CitizenCon? Seemed like a pipe dream that a ship could just roll up and start spitting out outposts. Crazy genius did it though, right?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Polaris_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking to upgrade a militia, the Polaris is a no-brainer. It's got the torpedos. It's got the small craft bay. Vanduul see one of these patrolling a system, and chances are those gullets are running for the nearest jump point.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Prospector_IG_001_HeresTheGreat=Here's the great thing about the Prospector: you go out there and find the right spot to mine, the ship will basically pay for itself.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Prowler_IG_001_HardToBelieve=Hard to believe that our great great great grandparents were going toe to toe with ships just like this. All I can say is I feel damn lucky that T-Vars are on our side now.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Razor_IG_001_WhoWouldHave=Who would have believed that MISC could make a racer this sexy?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Reclaimer_IG_001_AReclaimerCaptain=A Reclaimer captain once told me that the only ship she hadn't ever salvaged was another Reclaimer. The things are so tough, they just keep flying.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Redeemer_IG_001_RedeemersDesignIs=Redeemer's design is a real winner, and if you're lucky enough to snatch this one up, it could be your next great gunship.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Reliant_IG_001_TheReliantIsnt=The Reliant isn't any old ordinary ship. MISC shoved the thing just chockablock with Xi'an tech. The way it rotates around feels like something out of a sci-fi spec vid.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Retalliator_IG_001_ImPrettySure=I'm pretty sure every captain out there shakes a bit in their boots when they see a Tali drawing near. This is a bomber desinged to inspire fear. The thing was pretty much made to chew through cap ships.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Sabre_IG_001_AegisReallyGot=Aegis really got it right when they were building the Sabre. It's light, but it still has enough going on that it can hold it's own. My only complaint is that the name is a bit close to a Cutlass. I keep having people come in who are confused about which one is which. Not sure how that's possible, but there you go.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_SanTokYai_IG_001_ItMayNot=It may not seem like the obvious choice, but let me tell you, you show up to a fight in one of these badass Xi'an warrior rigs and you are making a bold statement right there my friend.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Scythe_IG_001_YouKnowMy=You know my favorite part of flying a Scythe? The whole thing is just a big F you to all the duul out there. You tried to kill us, and now we're flying your ship and doing it better than you can. It's a real rush.

PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Terrapin_IG_001_IJustLearned=I just learned a little while ago that Terrapin is a kind of turtle. How much more sense does that name make now? You know like how the ship has all this heavy armor plating just like a turtle shell?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_UsraRover_IG_001_DidYouKnow=Did you know that most new planets found are first explored with the help of an Ursa? They're such a tough and durable rover that it's a natural pick.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Valkyrie_IG_001_ThisThingIs=This thing is less of a ship and more of a mobile fortress. With its heavy armor, you can deliver a full squad of pain and hurt to just about anywhere that needs an ass whoopin.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vanguard_IG_001_TheVanguardDeep=The Vanguard Deep Space Fighter. If you got a fight in deep space, this is the ship you're gonna want to be flying.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vulcan_IG_001_MyNephewJust=My nephew just bought himself a Vulcan. Started his own repair service out in Ferron. Refuels, repairs, rearms. He's really doing well for himself. I mean, I was hoping that he would work here with me, but if he's happy that's all that matters, right.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vulture_IG_001_ThisIsThe=This is the ship you want if you're looking to get into the salvaging game. Plus, you got to admit, the Vulture is just a great name for a ship.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_X1_IG_001_EverybodyWasExcited=Everybody was excited when Origin first announced they were getting into the open canopy market, and when they finally showed the X1, everybody was even more excited. The thing's got style to spare.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Bomer_IG_001_FighterPilotsAlways=Fighter pilots always think they're the heroes, but when it comes right down to it, wouldn't you rather have a ship that can deliver real stopping power like this bomber can?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Combat_IG_001_IfYouDo=If you do any mercenary work or you're just worried about security, than a fighter like this is a great way to put your mind at ease. Good offense is the best defense, right?
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Data_IG_001_JustTheOther=Just the other week I was watching Kaizen on the spec, and they were going on about how data is gonna be the future. Seems like this would be the perfect time to get data ship of your own.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_DropShip_IG_001_IAlwaysHear=I always hear people talking about space superiority, but for my credits, you're gonna want some boots on the ground. That's where a drop ship like this really shines. You can strategically insert a team where you need, when you need.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Exploration_IG_001_YouHearAbout=You hear about that explorer who discovered those ancient ruins a few weeks back in Elysium? I'm pretty sure they were flying a ship just like this one.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Fuel_IG_001_IAlwaysSay=I always say, you want to see a genuine smile, fly a fuel ship. You'll never feel as appreciated as you do when you top off someone who moments before had been stuck on the drift. Ships like this are the real lifeblood of the 'verse.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Industrial_IG_001_AtTheEnd=At the end of the day, what you really want to know is, can this ship get the job done? And if you're lucky enough to be her new owner, I think you'll know that answer soon enough.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Luxury_IG_001_TheWayI=The way I see it, with as much time as you're gonna spend on board your ship, it really is worth it make sure that you travel in comfort.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Medical_IG_001_ItImpressesMe=It impresses me to no end to think about all the brave men and women out there, risking their lives to help save the lives of others. Takes a real special kind of person to fly a medical ship, no doubt about that.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Mining_IG_001_YouKnowWhats=You know what's great? No matter what the government's doing, who the military's fighting, what system you're in, there's always one constant. People are gonna need resources.

PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Racing_IG_001_WhetherYouveBeen=Whether you've been racing for years, or you're just looking to get started, she's got what it takes to take home some trophys. All that's missing is the right pilot.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Salvage_IG_001_NowWhileAll=Now, while all the ships we sell are made to last, there's plenty of them out there that aren't so lucky. Salvage ship like this is always in demand.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Snub_IG_001_SnubsMakeA=Snubs make a great addition to any fleet. You want to hit up a moon on the weekend, or just take a fly around a planet, this'll make a quick work of it, and you don't have to spend all the extra credits on flying out a ship bigger than you need.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Support_IG_001_CannotExpressHow=Cannot express how happy it makes me every time I get to sell a ship like this. It's a tough life out on the black, and support ships make it a bit better for everyone. You could say flying a ship like this is almost noble in its own way.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_Welcome_IG_001_HeyWelcomeGreat=Hey, welcome. Great to have you.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Pitch_Welcome_IG_002_ComeInCome=Come in, come in.

PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Purchase_EncourageASOP_IG_003_AllRightIm=All right, I'm having the crew bring it around and your new ship should be all ready for you at the ASOPs whenever you want to take her out.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Purchase_PaymentResponse_NotEnoughCredits_IG_001_OhThatsTough=Oh, that's tough. Not enough credits, huh? Maybe something else around here is more in your price range.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Purchase_PaymentResponse_NotEnoughCredits_IG_002_FundsALittle=Funds a little tight, huh? Know how that goes.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Purchase_PaymentResponse_PurchaseCompliment_IG_001_IThinkYou=I think you just made one hell of a good decision.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Purchase_PaymentResponse_PurchaseCompliment_IG_002_HowGoodDid=How good did that just feel? No rush like buying a new ship.
PU_SHIPDEALER1_M_CP_Purchase_PaymentResponse_PurchaseCompliment_IG_003_LetMeBe=Let me be the first to congratulate you on your new ship. I hope the two of you will be very happy for years to come.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_BS_Chat_ConvoInterupt_IG_001_OhYeahYou=Oh... yeah... you need a second. Sure.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_BS_Chat_ConvoInterupt_IG_002_WhereTheHell=Where the hell are you going?

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_BS_General_Passing_IG_002_ExcuseMe=Excuse me.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_BS_General_Passing_IG_003_JustGonnaSlide=Just gonna slide on by you real quick.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_BS_General_StrangeBehavior_IG_002_ImTryingTo=I'm trying to run a business here.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_BS_General_StrangeBehavior_IG_003_YouOkayThere=You okay there?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Chat_SmallTalk_IG_001_HowYouDoin=How you doin'? You good? Good. That's good. I'm good too. Had a bit of a late one last night.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Chat_SmallTalk_IG_002_YouDoAny=You do any of those Schrader seminars? They really realign your thinking, how you view the universe, and all that. The key to it is a meditation called "goal fixation." Made a helluva a lot of sense. You should look into it.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Chat_SmallTalk_IG_003_YouKnowIm=You know, I'm an aspiring entrepreneur by trade. All this is great and all, but it's just the day job, you know? I do some promotion, artist management on the side. Yeah, I got a bunch of irons in the fire if you catch me. It's just a matter of time before something pops.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Bed_IG_001_ThisOneEven=This one even comes with some habitation facilities, perfect if you're gonna be on the drift for a while.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Copilot_IG_001_GotAnExtra=Got an extra seat in there for a co-pilot, can help run secondary ship functions or maybe just act as a backup pilot so you can get some rest.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_MannedTurret_IG_001_ThisOnesAlso=This one's also got a manned turret, which if you ask me, raises the value ten-fold. I'd rather have a dedicated turret gunner than someone playing a video game remotely.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Missiles_IG_001_ThisOneComes=This one comes fully stocked with missiles. Nothing changes the tone of a battle faster than guidance-locked ordnance, am I right?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Multicrew_IG_001_LookingForA=Looking for a multicrew ship? This one's a beaut. Crewed one myself a couple years ago before I got this gig.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_OpenCanopy_IG_001_WithAllThe=With all the barriers we put between ourselves and our environments, there's something tremendously freeing about piloting without any. Don't you agree?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Ramp_IG_001_YoullAlsoFind=You'll also find a convenient ramp on this baby for easy access inside.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_Shower_IG_001_AlsoWhoDoesnt=Also, who doesn't like to keep themselves presentable? Well that is not a concern here, this model comes with a shower.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_SingleSeat_IG_001_ThisOnesFor=This one's for a solo pilot. It's a little bit more work as you have a lot more to pay attention to, but I find there's something satisfying about flying solo.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_AmenitiesComment_VTOL_IG_001_YouveProbablyNoticed=You've probably noticed the VTOL thrusters on this. They'll give you ultra-precise maneuvering when navigating around a landing pad. And require a lot less room to take off.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Aegis_IG_001_IfICan=If I can be honest, if you'd asked me five years ago, I'd have told you that Aegis Dynamics was dead in the water as a manufacturer, but nowadays they are everywhere. Don't get me wrong, they make good ships. This is a good ship. But yeah, it's just interesting is all.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Anvil_IG_001_ThereArentMany=There aren't many manufacturers that have the rep that Anvil ships have. From what I hear, they run every design through a rigorous internal review process before even starting production to make sure the ship is exactly what they want to make. Pretty impressive when you think about it.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Aopoa_IG_001_TheXianMake=The Xi'an make interesting ships, I'll give them that. You don't really see lines like this in Human construction.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Argo_IG_001_PeopleDontReally=People don't really mention Argo when talking about prominent manufacturers, but I guarantee, if you go to any kind of work site, you'll probably see this ship there.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_ConsolidatedOutlands_IG_001_ForMyMoney=For my money, there's no ship manufacturer doing more exciting things than Consolidated Outlands. Silas Koerner's a true visionary. Ships like this are just proof of that.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Crusader_IG_001_OneOfThe=One of the things I like about Crusader ships is that they aren't flashy. They aren't trying to redefine the wheel. They're just creating good ships and creating them well.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Drake_IG_001_YouKnowPeople=You know, people like to give Drake a hard time about the fact that some criminals like to use their ships, but I'll be honest, I've seen outlaws in every kind of ship imaginable. Doesn't change the fact that Drake makes good ships.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Esperia_IG_001_ALotOf=A lot of collectors tend to gravitate to Esperia ships. I'm not into reproductions myself, but just look at it... the level of detail they put into them is pretty staggering.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_GreycatIndustrial_IG_001_ILoveGreycat=I love GreyCat. I'll just say it.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Kruger_IG_001_IActuallyUsed=I actually used to race in a Kruger ship. Long time ago. It was purely amateur, but yeah, I was pretty good. People told me I could'a gone pro.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_MISC_IG_001_IKnowRsi=I know RSI usually gets the credit for building ships for regular people, but if you ask me, it's MISC. I mean, think about it, look at all the industrial ships they've constructed, how engrained they are with hauling, mining, even racing now. I don't know, MISC seems to be making a run for the title.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_OriginJumpworks_IG_001_IDontNeed=I don't need to say anything, right? I mean, an Origin ship is an Origin ship. Just take a moment, look at that. You know what I mean.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_RSI_IG_001_YouCanNever=You can never really go wrong with an RSI ship. It's not the most exciting sales pitch, but it's true. They've pushed innovation for centuries. You don't get to do that if you're making crap.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_BrandComment_Tumbril_IG_001_LookingForSome=Looking for some terrestrial technology? Tumbril's a good brand. Though they just relaunched, the tech's been around forever. I guess why fix what isn't broken.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_Busy_WithCustomer_IG_001_LetMeWrap=Let me just wrap up with my friend here and I'll come on by and check on you.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_Busy_WithCustomer_IG_002_WeGotSome=We got some business to discuss. I'll come check on you in a bit.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageBrowsing_IG_001_WhyDontYou=Why don't you have a look around and see if there's anything you like.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageBrowsing_IG_002_TakeAGander=Take a gander and see if something strikes your fancy.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageBrowsing_IG_003_TakeAWalk=Take a walk around, and just breathe it in, you know. It's a big decision.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageBrowsing_IG_004_IllLeaveYou=I'll leave you to it. Always find it's best to sit back, take in the space and let your ship call to you.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageBrowsing_IG_005_HeresWhatYou=Here's what you do. Just walk the place. If I'm making a decision as big as you're making, I like to take everything in before I do anything.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageDecision_IG_001_ItsABig=It's a big decision, so think it over.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageDecision_IG_002_TakeYourTime=Take your time. Think on it.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageDecision_IG_003_IllGiveYou=I'll give you a moment. Maybe go for a walk to think it over. That's always been my trick if I want to clear my head and look at the problem fresh.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageInspectShip_IG_001_FeelFreeTo=Feel free to hop in and take a feel. Don't take off though. <laugh> I'm kidding, you can't.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageInspectShip_IG_002_IfYouSee=If you see one you like, then go ahead and try it out. We've got the inhibitors on so don't you worry about crashing or blowing up the shop.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageInspectShip_IG_003_AllTheShips=All the ships should be open, so climb in and see how it feels. Odds are, you'll be spending a lotta time in there.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageSimCab_IG_001_WeAlsoHave=We also have a simcab if you wanna take any out for a spin.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageSimCab_IG_002_TheresASimcab=There's a simcab too, if you really want that complete experience of flying the ship.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageSimCab_IG_003_FeelFreeTo=Feel free to check out our simcab if you wanna see what flying the ship's really like. It's just like the real thing. I promise.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageTerminal_IG_001_WhyDontYou=Why don't you step on over to our terminal if you're looking for additional info. That can take care of you almost as good as I can. Promise.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageTerminal_IG_002_GoAheadAnd=Go ahead and hit up the terminal if you need. We usually have some extra inventory on there that's not on the floor.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageTerminal_IG_003_YouNeedAnything=You need anything else, check out the terminal. That'll have all those numbers and data if that's what you're into. Me, I'm all about how it feels.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_IG_001_YouGotA=You got a lot to think about, no question, but not for too long, a deal this good won't last.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_IG_002_JustSayThe=Just say the word and I'll start the paperwork, but it seems pretty obvious to me that the two of you are destined to be together.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_IG_003_SoWhatDo=So what do you think? We got a deal or what?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_IG_004_IMeanIts=I mean it's a lot of credits, sure, but what do you really have to think about?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_IG_005_ItsYourMoney=It's your money, but if it were me? The choice feels pretty obvious.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_UsedShip_IG_001_TheresNothingWrong=There's nothing wrong with buying used, you know. Every single one of mine I've bought secondhand. At least you know it's not gonna blow up the first time you turn it on.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_UsedShip_IG_002_IDontKnow=I don't know why you wouldn't buy used. Sure you don't get the bragging rights of saying it's brand new, but you ask me, used ships got more character.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_EncourageToBuy_UsedShip_IG_003_HonestlyIfIt=Honestly if it were up to me, I'd charge more for used ships. They've been out there. Tested. You know they can deliver. New ships? They got nice paint jobs.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_Excuse_FromCustomer_IG_001_YouKnowWhat=You know what? I'll get outta your hair. Hunt me down if you need anything.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_Excuse_FromCustomer_IG_002_YouExcuseMe=You excuse me for a moment? Thanks.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Beautiful_IG_002_EverybodyAlwaysStops=Everybody always stops to gawk at this one. Can't blame them really. Sleek lines. Impeccable design. It's a work of art really.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Fast_IG_001_IllLevelWith=I'll level with you. If you're looking to go slow, you need to walk away from this one right here. It's almost a psychological condition. You start up this monster, you'll be peeling metal.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Fast_IG_002_YouGotAn=You got an eye for speed, I see. Well, if that's the case, look no further. This one right here can knock paint off a space station. I had a customer even bring one back because it was too intense.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_GreatDeal_IG_001_IDontKnow=I don't know if you've looked at the price tag, but if not, let me be the first to tell you, that this baby is priced to move. I've had three people today asking about her, so if you're interested I'd move fast.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_GreatDeal_IG_002_YouArentGonna=You aren't gonna find a better deal. Not anywhere in the 'verse.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_HardWorking_IG_001_HeresWhatI=Here's what I like about this model here: fortitude. You can take it out, grind away for hours at a time and this baby'll eat that up and ask for more.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_HardWorking_IG_002_OhThisOnes=Oh, this one's a workhorse.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_001_ImSensingA=I'm sensing a connection here. Do you feel that? Yeah, you do. That's my superpower, sensing connections. Makes sense when you sell as much product as I do.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_002_WhatYoureLooking=What you're looking at right there is a classic. You get all these people clamoring for the 'newest, hottest thing' but give me worn and tested any day. Everything's great right out of the box, but if you can last, like really last, then you're onto something.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_003_HeresTheThing=Here's the thing, I could hit you with stats, figures, hull compression strength or whatever, but honestly, the decision's been made. You knew from the moment you looked at her.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_004_ForMyMoney=For my money, there's nothing I'd rather be piloting than this bad boy right here. It's everything you need, when you need it. In fact, if you're not gonna buy it, I might get it for myself.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_IG_005_YouKnowSomeone=You know, someone considerably wiser than me once said, "you don't pick your ship, your ship picks you." I think this one, this one right here is sweet on you.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Safe_IG_001_OneWordComes=One word comes to mind whenever I look at this one: trust. I know that thanks to dependable construction and cutting edge design, it will get me and my loved ones wherever we want to go and get us there in one piece.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Safe_IG_002_HeresTheGreat=Here's the great thing about this ship. It's safe. I know, I know, that sounds like a dirty word, but let me tell you, safe may not be sexiest marketing slang, but it's what all of us are ultimately looking for. Getting somewhere safe is priceless.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Strorage_IG_001_LookingForA=Looking for a transport? You could do a lot worse than this one. Plenty of open space for hauling whatever the hell you want.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipComment_Strorage_IG_002_OneOfThe=One of the great things about this baby here is space. If you're looking to haul, you can't go wrong with this model. I used this very ship to help move my parents into their new home. One of the easiest moves I've ever made.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_100Series_IG_001_YourEntryInto=Your entry into the world of Origin ships, but don't let that fool you. The 100s got all the excellence and design of its bigger brothers.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_300Series_IG_001_IsThereAnything=Is there anything sexier than a 300 series? The answer to that is yes, the one thing sexier is your 300 series.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_600Series_IG_001_OriginsResponseTo=Origin's response to RSI's Constellation line. Their goal with the 600 was to find that perfect balance between elegance and function. All you got to do is step aboard and you'll quickly realize that they nailed it.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_85X_IG_001_85XIsYour=85x is your weekend, fly over to that artisan deli and grab a picnic type of luxury ship. Simple, elegant, stunning.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_890Jump_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking for a ship that emits success, look no further. But I don't need to tell you that. Look at it. Success is basically forged into the hull.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_ArgoMPUV_IG_001_TheMpuvIs=The MPUV is short for Multi-Purpose Utility Vehicle. Argo has been pumping these things out like crazy. If you go to any kind of factory, hauling or mining facility, I guarantee you're gonna run into ten of them. Needless to say, they're popular for a reason.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Arrow_IG_001_YouWannaKeep=You wanna keep it fast and light. The Arrow's your ship. Anvil built her as a combat alternative to the Gladius. Were they successful? Depends on who you ask, maybe you can tell me where you land on it.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Aurora_IG_001_PeopleLikeTo=People like to sleep on the Aurora. Sure, you line it up against all the other ships in the 'verse and yeah, maybe it's a little weak, but I'll tell you this. I still fly mine every day. How many ships can you say that about?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Avenger_IG_001_YouGottaLove=You gotta love Avengers. For the longest time, everybody would immediately mistake you for a cop when you flew by. Still do in some parts of the Empire probably.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Blade_IG_001_TheVanduulLight=The Vanduul light fighter, lovingly... is that the right phrase? Anyway, created by the artists over at Esperia. This thing's light, it's nimble and a pitch perfect recreation of the original Vanduul design.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Buccaneer_IG_001_YouTalkTo=You talk to most dogfighters and they'll swear Aegis or Anvil up and down the show, but here's the thing. This bad boy right here is a born scrapper. You got a handful of guns at your disposal and enough speed to keep you out of someone's crosshairs. The rest is up to skill.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Carrack_IG_001_ImNotSure=I'm not sure if you're one of those who hear the call of the unknown, who have that gnawing desire to discover, to see what lies beyond. If that's you, than this... this is what you want at your side.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Caterpillar_IG_001_ImpressiveIsntShe=Impressive, isn't she? Asymmetrical hull design. Multiple cargo compartments to maximize your capacity. Even some crew living quarters for long runs. You know this ship design is almost a hundred years old? It just goes to show that ships don't have to be pretty to be innovative.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Constellation_IG_001_MyBrotherUsed=My brother used to say that he'd only really feel like a success if he could buy a Constellation. That, to him, was the pinnacle of space travel. To be fair, it's a helluva ship.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Crucible_IG_001_IllAdmitI=I'll admit, I was a little surprised to hear that Anvil was doing a repair ship. I guess blowing ships up gives you a pretty solid understanding of how to put them back together.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cutlass_IG_001_EverybodysGotAn=Everybody's got an opinion on the Cutlass. This was the ship that basically put Drake on the map. Gets a bad rap these days, but I don't know. At the end of the day, the ship's versatile, easy to maintain and affordable. None of that sounds bad to me.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Cyclone_IG_001_CyclonesHaveBeen=Cyclones have been racing around for hundreds of years. Like I always say, if there's something I gotta do planetside, a Cyclone can help pull it off.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Dragonfly_IG_001_ICantRide=I can't ride one of these things. I go too fast. It's just that addictive.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Eclipse_IG_001_TheEclipseJust=The Eclipse just reeks of pure warfare. I mean, come on, stealth bomber? How bad ass is that? I don't even want to bomb anything but this ship makes me want to.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Endeavor_IG_001_IWasAlways=I was always bad at science. Barely passed my classes to get Equivalency. But I got a ton of respect for people who like studying stuff. You strike me as a real intellectual so this ship would probably make a lot more sense to you.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_F8Lightning_IG_001_OhYeahThe=Oh yeah, the F8. It's what I like to call 'combat sexy.' It's got all the tools you need to absolutely wreck people, and it looks so bad ass doing it.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Genesis_IG_001_WeveAllBeen=We've all been on a Genesis at some point in our lives if we've done any kind of interstellar travel. The thing's basically the standard for commercial starliners.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladiator_IG_001_AnvilsGladiatorA=Anvil's Gladiator. A lotta people tend to right this bad boy off as a single-function ship. Good at dropping ordnance and not much else. But they forget that it's a multi-seater with a turret and some decent guns.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Gladius_IG_001_GladiusIsA=Gladius is a bonafide classic. I guarantee you walk up to any person, old or young, and they can pick this ship out of a lineup immediately. It's fought in wars, defended homesteads, everything. The Gladius is the dogfighter by which all dogfighters are measured.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Glaive_IG_001_YouWatchThe=You watch the Lost Squad? This is the exact type of ship that... oh what's his name... that Vanduul commander. I can never pronounce it. Anyway, this is what he flies. It's the variant of the Scythe that they give to their aces. Anyway, you should check out the show. It's pretty great.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hammerhead_IG_001_AhTheHammerhead=Ah, the Hammerhead. Not sure if you've ever seen one of these throw down, but... let's just say wow. It's one of those cap ships that's designed to handle fighters. Anyway, when this thing's firing all barrels, Navy pilots used to call it the Bloom of Death. Cool, right?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hawk_IG_001_AnotherPopularStarter=Another popular starter ship, the Hawk here's been increasingly popular with amateur bounty hunters or anyone who needs to chase people down and shoot at them.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Herald_IG_001_DrakesDataRunner=Drake's data runner is basically the answer to the question of what happens if you strap a cockpit onto a thruster. Not great on turns, but when you're going that fast, who cares.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_HerculesStarlifter_IG_001_OddsAreIf=Odds are if you need to move vehicles from planet to planet, you're looking at one ship. That's this baby right here.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hornet_IG_001_YouGottaLove=You gotta love the Hornet, right? Take a moment, look at her. Sure, she's a little boxy, but is there any ship more associated with space combat than the Hornet? I don't think so. Maybe the Gladius...
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_HullLine_IG_001_WhenYouOnly=When you only care about cargo space and nothing else. No frills. No amenities. Just cargo. There is a Hull for you.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Hurricane_IG_001_SpeedAndGuns=Speed and guns. A lethal combination in the right hands. You'll need it too. See the Hurricane here... well, to put it bluntly, isn't the sturdiest of ships. In a nutshell, it's a lot better at dishing out punishment than taking it. Not that I'm trying to dissuade you, just that you should know before buying.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Idris_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking into buying a frigate, I might have to close early today. Aegis' Idris has been the go-to for everybody from the UEE Navy to megacorps. Show up in one of these and I guarantee you make an impression.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_KhartuAl_IG_001_ThisOneWas=This one was the first ship Aopoa was allowed to sell in the UEE. A modification of the Xi'an military's light fighter, the Khartu'al is agile and surgical.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Kraken_IG_001_ALT_ThingsABeast=Thing's a beast, right? A customer of mine, who's very satisfied with this purchase, referred to it as the Human equivalent of the Merchantman. I'm not sure if that's exactly right, but it was a funny analogy.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Kraken_IG_001_ThingsABeast=Thing's a beast, right? Comes as a mobile strike carrier or a mobile marketplace. A customer of mine, who's very satisfied with this purchase, referred to it as the Human equivalent of the Merchantman. I'm not sure if that's exactly right, but it was a funny analogy.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_M50_IG_001_IHopeYou=I hope you aren't allergic to speed. It's damn near impossible to keep a beast like the m50 in anything remotely resembling a reasonably safe speed.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Mercury_IG_001_TheCrusaderReps=The Crusader Reps hate it when I call the Mercury a blockade runner. They think it's implying that it was built for illegal use, but I think it's a compliment. You want to move some cargo or got a courier job but you gotta do it with speed, agility, and pack a nice punch? Mercury's got your back.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Mustang_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking for a versatile starter ship, I personally recommend the Mustang. Silas Koerner's a personal hero of mine and what he's done with this ship is really something.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Nova_IG_001_AnotherBangerFrom=Another banger from Tumbril, the Nova is a modern update of the classic battle tank. This thing can shred targets on the ground or in the air. The main cannon is absolutely deafening. It's pretty cool.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Nox_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking to blast around in a truly futuristic open canopy racer, I can't recommend the Nox enough. The thing absolutely blazes.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Orion_IG_001_RsisDedicatedMining=RSI's dedicated mining platform. The Orion's the one you go to when you need large scale mining solutions.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_P52Merlin_IG_001_CoolRightTheres=Cool, right? There's something to be said about short-range ships. There's a purity to the experience that I kinda lose when I get in the bigger ones.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_P72Archimedes_IG_001_IllBeHonest=I'll be honest, I love taking this baby out for a little spin during breaks. Not this one here, we got another in the back, but seriously, if you're looking for something short-range, the P72 is where it's at. Hands down.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_PTVBuggy_IG_001_ThisLittleBuggy=This little buggy is just what it is. No frills. Dependable and fun as hell to drive. Buddy of mine used to build race tracks for them.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Pioneer_IG_001_ImpressiveIsntIt=Impressive, isn't it? I'm not sure if you read Silas Koerner's last book, but he talked a lot about technology throughout Human history. You ask me, I think this ship's gonna change things. It's opening up planetary settlement in really exciting ways.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Polaris_IG_001_PartOfRsis=Part of RSI's larger capital ship skunkworks, the Polaris is a corvette-class combat vessel. They released it as part of the UEE's Militia Mobilization Initiative, but private Merc companies and even Corporate Security outfits have been snatching them up.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Prospector_IG_001_ThereAreSome=There are some who say the Prospector's just a starter ship. That it's for amateurs, but here's the rub. Sure, it's not taking down massive hauls, but it's for people who like to work.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Prowler_IG_001_EsperiaGotSome=Esperia got some ridiculous access to an original Tevarin model to create this line of replicas. You ask me, this looks like something out of a Spec vid. Back in the war, they'd use these to drop boarders on capital ships. How nuts is that?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Razor_IG_001_WhenMiscAnnounced=When MISC announced they were jumping into the racing game, I was like 'what?! no way.' but the second you fire up the engines on this puppy... you put away your doubts.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Reclaimer_IG_001_IllTellYou=I'll tell you. If you're looking to chew up some debris, you absolutely cannot go wrong with the Reclaimer. This thing is the patron saint of salvage.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Redeemer_IG_001_TheRedeemerWas=The Redeemer was a bit of an experiment for Aegis, but the gunship has definitely found some supporters in the private contractor arena. You ask me, it's because of those rotating nacelles.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Reliant_IG_001_MiscsReliantIf=MISC's Reliant. If there's anything that signifies how far our relationship with the Xi'an has come, it's this ship. Hell, the damn thing turns vertical like one of theirs.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Retalliator_IG_001_HeresTheThing=Here's the thing, if you need to absolutely bomb something into last week. You need a Retaliator. They been doing it for hundreds of years.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Sabre_IG_001_NowThisThis=Now this, this is a fun ship. While you've got the Hornet for brawling, the Sabre's a more elegant alternative. Fast and precise lethality. I came up with that.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_SanTokYai_IG_001_AopoasReallyUpping=Aopoa's really upping their game in the UEE markets, the San... San'tak... however you pronounce it is supposed to be a scrapper through and through.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Scythe_IG_001_VanduulScytheProbably=Vanduul Scythe. Probably the most known fighter in their armada. This one here? This was captured from a Vanduul defector in Orion. I'm kidding, it's a repro made by Esperia. Looks pretty convincing, right?
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Starfarer_IG_001_OneOfThe=One of the big boys of hauling, you can't really go wrong with the Starfarer.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Terrapin_IG_001_TheTerrapinHere=The Terrapin here, it's got a real interesting history, but you aren't here about history, right? If you want to push out beyond the reach of civilization, search for the new, then this is the ship for you.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_UsraRover_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking to do some planetside exploration, look no further. The Ursa may not have the speed as something like the Cyclone, but it's rugged, dependable and capable of going anywhere.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Valkyrie_IG_001_BeforeIStart=Before I start talking, just take a moment and breathe in this ship. <pause> Anvil's Valkyrie. Designed as a heavy troop transport, it's armed, it's armored, it's a killer.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vanguard_IG_001_YeahTheVanguard=Yeah, the Vanguard here's one of the newer ones from Aegis. They'd had some older heavy fighters back in the day, but they went back to the drawing board with this one to create something thoroughly modern and undeniably deadly.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vulcan_IG_001_AegisVulcanSmall=Aegis' Vulcan. Small, mobile refuel and rearm ship. It's perfect for do-gooder types and budding entrepreneurs. This is one of those ships that pays for itself. You get one of these out on the drift and I guarantee you'll be pulling in credits in no time.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_Vulture_IG_001_LookingToCrack=Looking to crack into the salvage game? I don't blame you. There's some good money in it. My dad dragged scrap for years and never hated a day of work. Drake dropped the Vulture here to provide a small, solo option for salvage pilots.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipNameComment_X1_IG_001_OriginsAdditionTo=Origin's addition to the open canopy market. Spared no expense either. Aside from the usual Origin quality, they even brought back Alberto Vara to design the thing, so it's not just fast, but beautiful.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Bomer_IG_001_BeCarefulIm=Be careful! I'm just kidding. This bad boy's a devastator though. Capable of delivering ordnance with surgical precision. Now, I don't know what you're looking to blow up with this, but I'll just say that whatever it is, it doesn't stand a chance.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Combat_IG_001_WellIfYoure=Well, if you're looking to tear it up with somebody, you could do a lot worse than this one here. This one's a surefire, Grade-A certified brawler.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Data_IG_001_AfterThatOrigin=After that Origin hack from a few years ago, everybody's putting more stock in securing their data, so ships like this are becoming more and more in demand.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_DropShip_IG_001_WhatYoureLooking=What you're looking at here is a combat juggernaut. It's got firepower, sure. Armor, check. But it's really designed to punch through defenses and deliver troops. Here's the thing though, dropships like this aren't only good for dropping people off, they make excellent extraction ships too.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Exploration_IG_001_IAlwaysAdmired=I always admired people who wanted to explore the universe. I'm too much of a homebody. Take me away from anytime food delivery and spectrum feeds and I lose my mind.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Fuel_IG_001_LookingIntoA=Looking into a fuel ship, huh? You can't go wrong with this one.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Industrial_IG_001_IndustrialShipsAre=Industrial ships are definitely a bit of a niche market, but without fail, I hear good things about this one here.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Luxury_IG_001_YouCantReally=You can't really put a price on luxury. I mean, you can obviously, but in a larger sense, the ability to travel in the ultimate comfort in an environment designed in the pursuit of pure excellence can't really be quantified.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Medical_IG_001_WeDontHave=We don't have a lot of medical ships and to be honest, I'm not as schooled about them, but I've heard good things about this one. Paramedic from Ferron came through last week and gave me the run down.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Mining_IG_001_MyOldMan=My old man was a miner. Sixty years sledging rock on planets, asteroids, you name it, he cracked it. I learned early on, that life wasn't for me, but if it's something that you're looking into pursuing, you can't go wrong with this ship here.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Racing_IG_001_RacerHuhYouve=Racer, huh? You've got that look. Well, if you need a new rig, this one can definitely sort you out. Speed, agility, all the things that'll pay out in spades on the track.

PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Snub_IG_001_IllAdmitI=I'll admit, I got a soft-spot for snub nose ships. Yeah, they don't have the kind of features that the larger ships do, but to me they're efficient. Fast, lean, stripped down. They get down to the essence of flying.
PU_SHIPDEALER2_M_CP_Pitch_ShipTypeComment_Support_IG_001_TheseAreThe=These are the types of ships that keep the universe together. Support ships like her are the backbone of Humanity. If you ask me, it's a proud tradition for those who take up the call.

ProtLife_TimeSensitive_Recover_Desc_001=A claim has been processed for a ~mission(Location) belonging to one of our policy holders after the vessel was recently rendered inoperable.\n\nHowever, Olympus Principal has learned that there may still be valuable packages of zeta-prolanide onboard in a salvageable state. The successful salvage of these materials would go a long way in helping us recuperate our expenses, and as such, we are seeking a contractor to perform the retrieval operation on our behalf.\n\nAs you may know, zeta-prolanide is extremely volatile. If it is not kept in a powered stabilizer, it will grow dangerously unstable over time. We believe that salvage from ~mission(Location|Address) should still be stable for a little while longer, but be mindful as soon as they are removed you will only have a limited amount of time to deliver them to ~mission(Destination|Address). \n\nWhen approaching the incident site, please be on alert in case dangerous or hostile elements are still present.
ProtLife_TimeSensitive_Recover_Desc_002=Olympus Principal is seeking a salvage team to remove valuable packages of zeta-prolanide from a recently lost ~mission(Location). The hope is that the recovery of these materials will be able to offset any expenditures related to our client's claim of loss.\n\nAs you may know, if zeta-prolanide is not kept in a powered stabilizer it becomes extremely volatile over time. This will make any salvage attempt more complicated. \n\nOnce the containers are removed from ~mission(Location|Address) you will only have a limited amount of time to deliver them to ~mission(Destination|Address) before they become dangerously unstable. \n\nThere is a chance that word of this valuable salvage has gotten out to other interested parties and it is recommended that you proceed with caution in case there are hostiles present.
ProtLife_TimeSensitive_Recover_Desc_003=An inoperable vehicle claim has recently been filed by one of our clients for a ~mission(Location). The vessel was lost while transporting valuable packages of zeta-prolanide. It is our belief that those containers are still intact, and as the current property owner, Olympus Principal is eager to attempt to salvage them.\n\nWe are seeking professionals to handle this operation on our behalf owing to the dangerous nature of transporting zeta-prolanide once it is removed from a powered stabilizer. After you collect the containers from ~mission(Location|Address) you will only have a limited amount of time to deliver them to ~mission(Destination|Address) before they become dangerously unstable and lose all value to us. Please be very mindful of these time constraints.\n\nNote that other interested parties (possibly hostile) may have gotten word of the valuables onboard the wreckage, and extreme caution should be used in the area.

RedWind_Delivery_Illegal_Desc_05=RED WIND LINEHAUL\n'YOUR GOODS IN GOOD HANDS'\n----------------------------\n\nGot another special job that I could use you on.

You really don't want to have to explain a mix up to these particular clients.\n
RedWind_Delivery_Illegal_Desc_Intro=RED WIND LINEHAUL\n'YOUR GOODS IN GOOD HANDS'\n----------------------------\n\nI know you've done some solid work for us in the past, so I figured I'd see if you were interested in handling a bit of a special run for us that's a bit farther out in the system than what you've been doing so far.\n\nIn a nutshell, we need a pilot who's willing to keep their head down, focus on getting the packages delivered, and most importantly, not ask a lot of questions.\n\nSee, for a smaller company like us, staying ahead of competition means that we need to offer our clients something they can't get elsewhere - discretion. At Red Wind, as long as you got the credits we'll take whatever to wherever. Understand?\n\nIf that sounds good to you, let's see how you do on this run -\n\nPACKAGES FOR PICK UP (ANY ORDER)\n     · Package #~mission(item1|serialnumber) from ~mission(Pickup1|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item2|serialnumber) from ~mission(Pickup2|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item3|serialnumber) from ~mission(Pickup3|Address)\n\nDROP OFF LOCATIONS (ANY ORDER)\n     · Package #~mission(item1|serialnumber) to ~mission(Dropoff1|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item2|serialnumber) to ~mission(Dropoff2|Address)\n     · Package #~mission(item3|serialnumber) to ~mission(Dropoff3|Address)\n\nOne last bit of advice, it would probably be good to avoid any unnecessary delays once you got the packages onboard, for example being searched by local law enforcement. \n

The gravity generator's going to need a complete overhaul to get it working again, and that means we need to park up in a garage for a few days. \n\nSince I know we’re not going to do that until this job's done, and there’s a good chance the gravity's going to keep fritzing out on us which is less than ideal, so in the meanwhile, I went ahead and rigged the engineering console to allow anybody to do a hard reset of the system if they need to.\n\nFigure at least this way if I'm gunked up patching another part of the ship you all don't have to wait for me.\n\n-Judy\n

RetrieveDatapad_desc=Ran into a bit of crap luck that I'm hoping you can help me right.\n\nA few days ago, I hired the crew of the 'Pride of Arliss' to obtain some important data for me. They pulled off the job no problem, but the bastard of a captain comm'd me demanding more credits. Turns out it wasn't the first time he's tried to pull this trick either because in middle of "negotiating" with me, his ship was attacked by some very pissed off individuals looking to teach him a lesson.\n\nOur comm got cut off when the shooting started and that was the last I heard from him. I'm guessing he's as good as ghosted, but I want you to head to the Pride of Arliss and try to get my data off the captain's personal datapad.\n\nOnce you have it, I set up a secure transmission channel at the ARC-L1 rest stop. Travel there and when you're in range, submit the data to me through this contract to get paid.\n  \nDon’t try to screw me over either. Karma can be a real asshole.\n

Retrievedatapad_Crew_Journal_01=To: Marcel Brickley\nFrom: Tania Adlett\nSubject: What Goes Around Comes Around\n\nLook, I love credits as much as the next person, but I got a feeling what the Captain's been doing isn't going to fly for very long. All this double-crossing and blackmailing is going to catch up to him, and we're gonna be left holding the bag.  \n\nI think we should say something to him. I'd do it myself, but I know he listens to you. I'm not saying we need to go clean or anything, just be a little more careful with our dealings is all. I mean, you and I both know what the Nine Tails are capable of. Did we really need to get on their bad side?\n\nLet me know what you want to do,\nTania\n

Ruto_Allies=Nine Tails
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_E_Desc=Here's the deal. ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) need to die at the same time. Unfortunately, they aren't gonna be in the same place.\n\nA double hit can sound complicated, but if you hire some additional guns it shouldn't be all that hard to do two hits simultaneously.\n\nMake sure you find folks who have skills as I have it on good authority that each'll be flying with some escorts for "protection." 
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_E_Title=together forever
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_H_Desc=Have another pair that needs simultaneous deathing. Seems to be getting more and more popular as a murder option. \n\nThis time it's ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2). Both are supposed to be pretty skilled operators and they won't be flying alone. \n\nI'd make sure whoever you get to help you on this one can handle a fight. 
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_H_Title=twice the headache
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_Intro_Desc=Guess what ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) have in common? \n\nYou're gonna kill 'em both!\n\nDifficult part is that I need you to kill them at the same time so that one doesn't have a chance to escape, or worse, kill the person trying to kill them. \n\nSo put together a team to track one target while you handle the other. Divide and conquer!\n\nAnd despite the fact they made a mess big enough to get themselves killed, my understanding is that they are relative lightweights. Don't expect you to meet too much resistance.
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_Intro_Title=simultaneous release
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_M_Desc=I really hope that you're not buddies with ~mission(TargetName) or ~mission(TargetName2) because I need you to ghost the pair of them... at the same time...\n\nOf course they wouldn't make this easy on us and travel in the same ship or something obvious like that. No. You're going to have to put together a crew so that you can down both targets simultaneously. \n\nAs soon as one of them is dead, be ready to drop the other one too. Can't risk either of them getting away.\n\nAnd I figure I should mention that not only are both pretty good pilots, but that they'll be traveling with backup too. Nothing you can't handle I'm sure.
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_M_Title=friends to the end
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_S_Desc=If you had asked me, I would've said ~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) would have wound up eventually killing each other. But instead you're going to get the honor of killing them both at the same time.\n\nYou're going to have to work for it, though.\n\nEach one is trouble. Serious records, highly trained, and too smart to fly without backup.\n\nGather the best crew you can on this one. You'll need it. And don't be stingy. You can't spend credits if you're dead.
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_S_Title=double trouble
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_VE_Desc=It's pretty touching when you run across a pair that's willing to die for one another. Stupid but touching.\n\n~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2) chose to stand by each other and now its gone and got them dead.\n\nFind a friend of your own and hunt each of these two down. Make sure you kill them at the same time. Call it poetic justice.\n\nThey should die pretty easy. Maybe they'll have a ship or two with them but I don't think it'll be anything to worry about. 
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_VE_Title=death do us part
Ruto_Assassin_Sync_VH_Desc=~mission(TargetName) and ~mission(TargetName2). I think they may be related? Or dating? Doesn't really matter, someone wants them killed. \n\nI've arranged it so that you can hit them when they're not flying together. Safer for you this way. They are both serious business and fly with equally serious backup.\n\nMake sure you and your crew time your attacks. I don't want one of them left alive or it's going to be a real headache.

We’re too busy to snag it ourselves, so why not spread the wealth, right?\n\nIf you send us some credits, we’ll send you the ship’s exact coordinates. Don’t take too long to think it over, though. You’ve probably got about ~mission(timer) minutes until security gets there to check out the wreck. Could be more, could be less.\n\nIf you’re fast enough, you can get in, get your haul, and get out without a shot fired. Not a bad deal, right? And once you've salvaged everything you want, just go ahead and abandon this contract to clear your map. Helps keep everything nice and tidy.
TarPits_TimedSalvage_Desc_02_ChickenShip=We got word that Adagio has a salvage contract coming for a ~mission(ship). If you’re interested in swooping in, we can sell you the coordinates for a nice discount. Gotta decide fast, though.\n\nSome unlucky salvager will probably buy the rights to the claim soon, but our guess is that it’ll take at least ~mission(timer) minutes until they get there. If they see you picking at their claim, they might call security on you but if you’re any good you should have plenty of time. And if you’re slow, I guess you can just shoot them down before they send word to anyone, right?

Tut01_Journal01_GettingStarted_Content=Welcome to Star Citizen!\n\nYou have just stepped 930 years into a future where Humanity has spread across the stars under the rule of the United Empire of Earth (the UEE). While many Humans spend their lives never leaving their homeworld, there are those who choose to travel aboard advanced starships, braving outlaws, hostile aliens, and hazardous conditions to seek their fortune.  \n\nCurrently, you are in Area18, on ArcCorp, the third planet in the Stanton System – a great distance from Humanity’s origins in the Sol System. The four planets in the system are owned by megacorporations who each purchased a planet from the UEE and now govern their own region of space. They are: Hurston Dynamics, Crusader Industries, ArcCorp, and microTech. \n\nArea18 is the main commercial zone of the mega-city that sprawls across the surface of ArcCorp. From here, the tutorial will guide you to Baijini Point, the space station in orbit above the planet that can serve as your gateway to further exploration of the Stanton system.
Tut01_Journal01_GettingStarted_Title=Tutorial - Welcome to the 'Verse
Tut01_Journal02_TheBasics_Content=The universe of Star Citizen is a dynamic place, providing players with the ability to interact with much of the environment around them. The foundation of this ability is the game’s Interaction Mode. \n\nIf you are in range to interact with an object – like a door or item of food – it will be highlighted blue and a number of options will appear, defining the various ways you can interact with that item. The option you are currently selecting will be highlighted in a brighter color than the other options. \n\nYou can also Quick Interact with objects to do the main action associated with it. For example, Quick Interacting with a closed door will open it. It'll also pick up an item, loot a container, and switch lights on or off.\n\nYou can also use Interaction Mode to zoom in or zoom out on objects you’re looking at. When interacting with an interface, you can also scroll through the list of available options on the display. For example, you can scroll through the list of floor options while interacting with an elevator panel.\n\nFor all manners of interaction, you may prefer to use different keybinds. To view all the current keybinds or adjust them, use the Keybinding tab of the Options menu.

Tut02_Journal01_Trading_Content=The universe of Star Citizen has many unique pieces of equipment and clothing for you to use. These items may be looted from adversaries but can also be purchased from the numerous stores around the ‘verse. Specialized stores at major landing zones tend to have the necessary stock to cover your basic needs, whereas quieter areas might have unique variants or niche equipment.\n\nTo buy an item on display, approach it and enter Interaction Mode. The brand logo, item name, and price will be displayed, as well as options to BUY, TRY ON, or INSPECT the item. If you like what you see and have the necessary funds, selecting the BUY option will open your mobiGlas so you can complete the purchase.\n\nYou can also use Interaction Mode to browse the shopping kiosks. While these kiosks are not as hands-on, it is easier to buy goods in volume through the kiosk interfaces. Kiosks also give you the option to choose where the items will be delivered – either to your local storage or directly to your personal inventory.\n\nTo sell items, first make sure that they are in your personal inventory, local storage, or are cargo on a vehicle stored at that location. Then you can interact with a shopping kiosk at a store and use the “SELL” tab. From there you will be given options to select which items you wish to sell. Not all stores will purchase all items.\n\nPERSONAL INVENTORY\nYour Personal Inventory is the storage on your character. You can use this screen to arrange and organize your items, transferring them between your Personal Inventory and Local Storage or equipping them to your character. Take note that certain items have requirements for when they can be equipped, such as armor needing to be placed on an undersuit. All inventories have a capacity bar near the top that indicates how much they can store. \n\nLOCAL STORAGE\nYour Local Storage is unique to the current zone you are in. For example, if you are on microTech you will no longer have access to your Area18 storage. While Local Storages are significantly larger than Personal Inventories, they still have their own maximum capacity.\n\nAs you accumulate a high number of items, you can use the tabs at the top of the Local Inventory window to filter through specific categories of items and equipment.\n\nVehicles also have their own storage capacity. This inventory is not shared with any other players aboard and remains accessible to you while onboard the vehicle or while that vehicle is parked at your current landing zone.\n\nLOSING ITEMS\nRemember, when you get into dangerous situations out in the ‘verse you risk losing your items! Things in your personal inventory at the time of your death will remain on your corpse and will need to be retrieved. The same is true when a vehicle is destroyed. There is a chance that other players will find and claim your lost items before you can.\n\nAnything in storage at a major city landing zone is safe regardless of what happens to you or your vehicles.
