He really only needed to be able to fend off a few shots, because after that he would either have maneuvered his ship out of targeting range, or he would have lost the race anyway. Gutting apart an existing shield by hand, Yorm hacked together a lighter shield that would draw less power and only protect him just enough to escape. Soon, many other racers were trying to mimic his efforts, and when Yorm retired, he went on to successfully sell his modified shield design.

mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_001=A tremendous opportunity seems to have landed... well crashed in our favor. A Hurston satellite has quite ungracefully plummeted to the surface. Thankfully, it appears that a ~mission(Item) has miraculously survived the incident.\n\nNow, I know that there are plenty of Hurston's rivals who would be... eager... to get an advance look at this tech. I'm sure I could convince them to pay handsomely for an opportunity like this, but I'll need you to retrieve it. You can start your search at the ~mission(Location) and work out from there. \n\nOnce recovered, you will only have a short time to upload the information from the ~mission(Item) using the decryption software on a designated Hurston server before its security protocols cause it to self-destruct. Your best bet will be to access a data center inside one of the storage facilities that dot the surface of the planet. They typically have minimal security so I don't foresee you running into any issues. \n\nNeedless to say, I will pay you handsomely upon completion and we can both bask in knowledge that Hurston has been hit where it hurts.\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)
mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_002=I managed to intercept an interesting bit of news coming over the comms. It seems Hurston's fortunes are falling quite literally; one of their satellites has crashed to the surface. Not all is lost however, for the valuable ~mission(Item) onboard appears to have survived the impact.  \n\nNow, this is one of those moments where enterprising individuals face a choice. Either do nothing, let Hurston reclaim their property and let this wretched world keep turning or seize the opportunity to capitalize. Personally, I'm leaning towards the latter and I'm hoping you feel the same. \n\nIf you were to obtain the part from the ~mission(location) before Hurston does, I'm sure I could find some parties interested in paying handsomely for a sneak peek at Hurston's hard work.\n\nOne catch (as always), is that in order to safely decrypt and extract the data, you must connect it to an official Hurston server before its security protocols cause it to self-destruct. I recommend using a storage facilities data terminal. They tend to be easier to access than anything that can be found in Lorville proper. Once the transfer is complete, I will issue your just rewards.\n\nBest of luck,\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)
mg_clovus_bladesteal_desc_003=My Dear Compatriot,\n\nWonderful tidings. It seems that we have received an unexpected but most welcomed guest - a Hurston satellite has been ejected from orbit and crashed practically straight into our laps. Most importantly, the ~mission(Item) onboard has survived intact.  \n\nNow, it just so happens that this cutting-edge Prototype has been long desired by some deep-pocketed associates of mine. If you were able to acquire this wayward Blade from the ~mission(Location) before Hurston manages to do so, I could ensure significant restitution for your time and troubles.\n\nThe only real wrinkle is that the information on the Prototype is inaccessible (and will self-destruct) unless connected to an official Hurston server. Fortunately, there is access to the said server dotted around the planet inside Hurston Storage Facilities. It should be short work for you to get the Blade and then take it to the server for decryption and extraction. Once the data transfer is finished, I will happily transfer the well-earned credits into your account. \n\nSafe travels,\n\n-cd\n\n~mission(Update)

mg_clovus_bladesteal_update_01=UPDATE: Looks like someone has beaten us to the punch. We cannot allow some second rate hoods sell the data. My reputation would be devastated.

If you restart the satellite's main internal control system, it should reactivate the ~mission(Item) and allow you to identify its current status.
mg_clovus_bladesteal_update_02=UPDATE: It seems we were not the only ones eager to abscond with the blade. Can you imagine the impertinence of poaching in my territory? If word gets out, the implications could be ruinous. It cannot stand. The only option is for you to stop the decryption before they can complete their sale.\n\nTo track down the current location of the ~mission(Item), restart the satellite's main internal control system. It should activate the tracking protocol and allow you to find the culprits responsible.
mg_clovus_bladesteal_update_03=UPDATE: It seems Hurston Security's much more competent than I thought. They've identified your location and are sending mercenaries to your position as we speak. Protect the ~mission(Item) until the transfer is complete. Otherwise, all of this will be for naught.
mg_clovus_bladesteal_update_04=UPDATE: Unfortunate news. Hurston Security has gotten word of our little pilfering ploy and their ruthless thugs are hunting you down at this very moment.

mg_miles_capturegang_desc_006=ECKHART SECURITY, LLC.\nCONTRACTS & DISPATCH\n\nCONTRACT TYPE: Group Warrant\nCONTRACTOR STATUS: Independent\nApproval code: = ~mission(Contractor|ApprovalCode)\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE PROCESSING\n\n*********\n__Background Information__\nA group warrant has been issued for the notorious Arlington ship jacking gang after their recent brazen attempted theft of an Idris from a repair yard. While the heist was stopped, the members of the group have scattered to the black. Eckhart Security has been granted the bounty for the immediate capture of all high-level gang members: Maltrox Arlington, Kass Dent, Nicks Cantwell, Sam ‘Weepy’ Arlington, Oslo Arlington, and Les Arlington.\n*********\n\nMaltrox Arlington has been keeping a low profile recently, but we think he's come out of hiding. A patrol was refueling at a station when one of their ships was boosted. Maltrox is the most likely suspect. While the regtag was temporarily deactivated, we have been able to trace the ship’s quantum signature and have provided you those coordinates.\n\nA third generation criminal, the Arlington gang has been under Maltrox’s leadership for the past six years. Be aware, this is a smart, aggressive, and very dangerous target. The more resources you can bring to bear, the more likely it is that we can bring Maltrox in one and for all. \n\nYou are authorized to use whatever force is necessary to neutralize the target. \n\nPayment will be issued upon successful completion of contract.\n\nThis contract is non-negotiable.\n\nThis message may contain confidential, proprietary, privileged and/or private information.

mg_miles_capturegang_desc_idris=ECKHART SECURITY, LLC.\nCONTRACTS & DISPATCH\n\nCONTRACT TYPE: Group Warrant\nCONTRACTOR STATUS: Independent\nApproval code: = ~mission(Contractor|ApprovalCode)\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE PROCESSING\n\nIt appears that second time's the charm for the Arlington gang. After one failed attempt, the recently escaped criminal family has managed to boost an Idris from a repair yard. Now we know what the mining laser and biometrics they stole were for. \n\nSince we had such success capturing them the first time, Eckhart Security has been granted the warrant for the gang’s arrest. This is going to take considerable firepower to bring down a capital ship of this ability.\n\nYou are authorized to use whatever force is necessary to track down the Idris and neutralize the gang.\n\nPayment will be issued upon successful completion of contract and will be adjusted based on the final evaluation of you and your team's combat effectiveness rating. \n\nThis contract is non-negotiable.\n\nThis message may contain confidential, proprietary, privileged and/or private information.

mg_miles_capturegang_escape_desc=\nGuess we celebrated too soon. Word came in a little while that there was a prison break. The Arlington gang somehow smuggled in components for an explosive and broke out.\n\nQuality work by whatever genius decided to put them all into the same holding facility. \n\nNot sure if they are the revenge type, but figured you deserved a head's up in case they come gunning for you. \n\n-Miles\n\nMiles Eckhart\nFounder & CEO\nEckhart Security, LLC.

mg_pacheco_DestroyEvidence_desc_001=It turns out that security over at ~mission(location|address) got their hands on a box of evidence that shouldn’t exist. I’m gonna pay you to destroy it for me.\n\nGetting to the evidence won’t be a walk in the park. You’ll have to make it past the station’s heavy security, and then take out the Chief of Security in order to get their access code to the Evidence Storage Unit. And even that’s not straightforward since the Chief only deals with high-level emergencies so I’m thinking you’ll have to shoot up the place pretty good before they feel it’s worth showing up. Bringing a crew with you is probably a good idea.\n\nOnce the Evidence Inventory System is started up, the box I want should be easy to find - it's blue and has "EVIDENCE" written on it. Destroy that and I’ll get you paid.\n\nWhat you do after that is up to you. There’s probably plenty of other valuable crap locked up in the Evidence Storage if you’re willing to hang around long enough to grab it, but that’s on you.\n\n-Twitch\n

Not only is the station crawling with security, but the access code to activate the Evidence Storage Unit is kept by the Chief of Security. In order to get to them, you’ll need to create enough havoc to force the Chief to come deal with you in person. I usually don’t like loud and messy, but this job calls for it. It wouldn't be a bad idea to bring a crew along to help.\n\nOn the bright side, the evidence I want should be easy to spot. The box is blue and says "EVIDENCE" on the side. Anything else you want to take from storage and sell is fine with me as long as you remember that I’m your priority. \n\nOnce you have my evidence, drop it off at ~mission(destination|address) and we can call it a day.\n\n-Twitch\n

The station is thick with security and the only access code to the Evidence Storage Unit is kept by the Chief of Security. To make things worse, that snotty bastard doesn’t like to get their hands dirty unless it’s a full-blown emergency which means that you’ll have to escalate things before the Chief will even bother coming round.\n\nOnce you do activate the Evidence Inventory System, the box I want should be the first one out. Now, there might be more boxes coming out after it, you can consider those your bonus payment. \n\nJust be sure that you take care of dropping off my evidence at ~mission(destination|address) first and foremost.\n\n-Twitch\n

mg_pacheco_prisonerbreak_desc_001=Here’s the deal - A couple of long timers got snagged pulling a job for me and I want you to spring them. \n\nA friendly mechanic has arranged for their prison transport to run into some trouble en route, venting the front door and bringing the ship to a halt. You’re gonna go, dispatch any security escorting the transport, find the prisoner manifest aboard, and use it to locate my crew’s cryopods.\n\nThe popsicles I’m after are ~mission(NameSave1), ~mission(NameSave2), ~mission(NameSave3), and ~mission(NameKill1). All have been loyal and deserve better than rotting in jail.\n\nAt least I think they've been loyal... I'm still wondering how they got pinched in the first place. I can't shake the feeling that one of them may have been doubling dealing. Tell you what, if you find any proof that one of my crew has been working with the Advocacy, liquidate their cryopod and I’ll see you get a bonus.    \n\nOnce you've activated the right pods and my people are starting to thaw, get the hell out of there and let my team handle the rest. This last bit is important. See, once they’re defrosted, they're gonna be sent off to retirement. No sense in them knowing any more about my business than they already do, i.e. I don’t want these lunks seeing your face or even knowing you exist. \n\nOnce you’re back on your way, I’ll send you a hefty pile of creds.\n\nNow just in case you’re getting any ideas along the lines of “Why don’t I just free everyone?” or “Wouldn’t it be easier to shut them all up permanently?” Forget it. The politics of this whole thing is more complicated than you need to know. Just understand that if any extra prisoners get freed or die without me ordering it, you’ll be the one who pays. Want all your money? Do what you’re told and that’s it. \n\n-Twitch

mg_pacheco_prisonerbreak_title_001=The Price of Freedom
mg_pacheco_stealstash__desc_0001=Word is that security are gonna hit a stash house known as ~mission(Location) that some scabbers are using to store a treasure trove of narcotics. Among their supply, they've managed to snag a particular package of Maze. Seems like they're trying to up their station in the world.\n\nPrice of Maze on the street is skyrocketing... which is weird. Stuff just looks like wood chips to me. Anyway, I've gotten word that BlacJac's been tipped off to this little operation, so let's just say, this presents us with a unique opportunity. I know when the raid's going to start, so I want you to hit the stash before they show up and bring the Maze back. \n\nYou'll need a ship that can haul at least one box, but feel free to use something bigger. Anything else in the facility is up for grabs if you want to bother lifting it. Just be sure to deliver our Maze to ~mission(Destination) and we'll be square. Copy? \n\nIf you run into any resistance, I'll trust you'll deal with it, but the Maze is the real prize here.\n\n-Twitch
mg_pacheco_stealstash__desc_0002=Some of our competition over at ~mission(Location) is about to run into massive load of bad luck. BlacJac's caught wind of their stash house and are posting up to raid it.\n\nI've managed to find out exactly when they're going to hit the stash house, but I want you to hit it first. I imagine that the crew that's operating the stash won't be too enthusiastic about you robbing their supply, so if you run into any opposition, handle it.\n\nI want you to go in and steal their supply of Maze before security destroys it. Like I said, there's a bunch of drugs in there, but lucky for you Maze just looks like pieces of tree bark which should make it stand out. If you bring a ship that can hold enough cargo, you're welcome to help yourself to any of the other drugs in there. \n\nJust make sure that you can at least haul out the one box of Maze we're paying you for over to ~mission(Destination).\n\n-Twitch
mg_pacheco_stealstash__desc_0003=There's this little corner of heaven called ~mission(Location) that some of the local scumbags use to hand off drug shipments. You ever hear of it? \n\nWell, as of a few hours ago, a source told me that they were moving a package of Maze through there. I'm not sure if you've ever danced with that stuff before, but it looks like bits of bark.\n\nMy employers want it, but for whatever reason, they aren't willing to declare open war on this group. Apparently they're protected by somebody. Anyway, I tipped off BlacJac about the stash and they're getting ready to raid it. \n\nI want you to go in and secure the Maze before the place gets burned. Odds are this stash is gonna be guarded, so make sure you break some weapons. If you want to help yourself to anything else in there, that's on you to bring a ship big enough to haul it out. But at the very least bring a ship that can handle carting off the one box of Maze that's ours to ~mission(Destination). \n\nDon't worry about clearing out scavs you find there, either. Unless they get in your way that is. Thankfully, BlacJac'll get blamed for whatever body count gets left behind.\n\n-Twitch

mg_ruto_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=Oh hello, I recently overheard a little bit of intel that ~mission(location|address) received some confidential materials that are of great interest to an acquaintance of mine. So interesting that they’re willing to pay for someone to storm the facility, grab the goods, and deliver them to ~mission(dropoff|address). Now I expect there to be plenty of security, who will most likely put up a fight, so I’d bring a gun or two. \n\nWord is the confidential materials were delivered in a consignment alongside other stuff and are now being stored in the facility’s automated vault. Senior security officers on-site carry datapads containing retrieval codes used to access the vault. You’ll have to get your hands on a datapad before using the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. \n\nIf you need a little sweetener, I’ve seen the manifest and can confirm that the other crates being stored at the facility are pretty choice. My client could care less about what happens to them, so they’re yours to do as you please. Run this right and those extra crates could be a nice bonus on top of the delivery fee for you.
mg_ruto_RetrieveConsignment_title_001=get the goods
mg_ruto_UGF_destroy_E_desc_001=Seems there’s a new upstart in the sector who hasn’t been paying the right dues to the right people. To teach them a little lesson, my client wants you to go down to ~mission(Location|Address) and destroy all the drugs on site.\n\nThe low-level lugs they got on site will probably make a stink about it and try to stop you. Handle them however you want but getting rid of the product is the most important thing.\n

mg_ruto_UGF_destroy_H_desc_001=A client of mine‘s trying to negotiate a deal, but isn’t having much luck. The other party feels like they got all the leverage because they’re sitting comfortably on a pile of inventory. To help move the negotiations along, I’m gonna need you to head down to ~mission(Location|Address) and destroy all the drugs on site. \n\nNow, I should probably tell you that the site’s being protected by some very serious people, so getting to the stash is going to be a bit tricky, but I trust you’ll find a way. \n
mg_ruto_UGF_destroy_H_title_001=inventory clear out
mg_ruto_UGF_destroy_desc_001=One of my clients has been unhappy to learn that someone's been muscling in on their territory. Now rather than going down the more traditional route of killing some people and starting a whole thing, they’ve opted to send a different kind of message instead.\n\nYou’re gonna go down to ~mission(Location|Address) and destroy all the drugs on site. \n\nOf course, if someone does wanna pick a fight with you, feel free to defend yourself, but getting rid of the product is the most important thing.\n
mg_ruto_UGF_destroy_title_001=out of stock

mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_allies_desc_001=One of my clients is planning a hostile takeover of a rival at ~mission(Location|Address), but word got out, and now they’re worried they’re not going to have enough fire power to see it through.\n\nI figured you would be the perfect addition to tip the scale in their favor and help my client’s people wipe out this other gang.\n\nThis last part is important though – they don’t want any workers hurt. They’re hoping to be able to start production again almost immediately and don’t want to bother with hiring new staff. Got that? Kill goons with guns, don’t kill workers.\n
mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_allies_title_001=hostile takeover
mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_civsonly_desc_001=A client is getting out produced by a new competitor and is looking to throw a wrench into the works.\n\nYou’re going to head to ~mission(Location|Address) and kill all the civies who work there. \n\nDo what you want with the gun-toting goons guarding the workers, but remember that they aren’t the priority.  \n
mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_civsonly_title_001=too many cooks
mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_desc_001=This is a bit aggressive for my taste, but credits are credits, right?\n\nGot a client who's looking for a highly motivated individual to head over to ~mission(Location|Address) and kill everyone who’s there. \n\nBasically, start shooting and don’t stop. You'll get paid once the site's clear.\n
mg_ruto_UGF_eliminateall_nocivs_desc_001=I know someone who’s looking to start up a new business, but they’re having a hard time hiring the skilled workers they need.\n\nNow the thing is, they found the perfect crew over at ~mission(Location|Address), but the people they work for won’t let them go. Even hired extra armed guards to make sure of it.\n\nWhat I want you to do, is go there and kill all the guards while making sure all the workers remain unharmed. \n

mg_ruto_assassin_danger_0001=And from what I've been hearing, this scav's dangerous. If you wanna stay healthy, be smart about how you handle this one.

mg_ruto_assassin_danger_0003=And so you know, you won't be the first person who's gone after ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst). People think that they're a little bulletproof. Might take a few shots to keep 'em down.

It'll help send a message to anyone else who's thinking about making trouble.
mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0002=I'm helping ~mission(Client) to arrange a funeral for ~mission(TargetName). I'm in charge of the entertainment but the only thing we're missing now is a corpse.

mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0003=~mission(TargetName) is a ghost. Problem is, no one's told them they're dead yet.

mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0004=A piece of trash that goes by the name of ~mission(TargetName) just surfaced at ~mission(Location). Need you to put them down. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) Last piece of advice - don't try to talk to them first or anything weird. Just do the job.
mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0005=Long story short, ~mission(TargetName) screwed over the ~mission(Client) and as it turns out, it's going to be the last thing they ever do. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) A friend of the ~mission(Client) spotted them near ~mission(Location) so I'd suggest starting there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) You find them, you put them down. Make it messy, make it clean. They didn't specify and I don't care. Just see that it's done right.
mg_ruto_assassin_desc_0006=The ~mission(Client) put out a hit on some local that's been stirring up trouble and you're going to execute it.

I’m all for a good quid pro quo.\n\nOne of my associates who was serving some time in Klescher was supposed to bring me a datachip, but then they went quiet. Now I’m assuming they’re dead, but here’s the deal: if you finish his job, I wipe your crimestat. Not bad, right?\n\nYour predecessor was apparently planning on using some old tunnels to make his escape. He made it sound like they weren't exactly the easiest thing to access, but I trust you can figure it out. I'm guessing you'll find his body somewhere in there and if we’re lucky, he'll still have the chip on him.\n\nOnce you get it, finish getting out however you can. Then get the data to me. There’s a spot nearby you can upload the chip’s contents. You might want to watch out for Hurston Security, though. They've been a hassle lately, so I wouldn't be surprised if you ran into them. After I get the data and validate it, I’ll wipe your crimestat. \n\nThen you can go and enjoy your newfound freedom. If you do this right, maybe I’ll have more lucrative work for you down the line.

mg_ruto_clearcrimestat_rep_desc_01=Hey there. I heard you ended up in Klescher which is a real drag. But it might actually be a lucky day for both of us.\n\nLong story short, I had somebody sneaking a datachip out of the prison, but they never got back to me. I know for a fact they haven’t left the facility, so I think something might have happened to them. While tragic, business must carry on. If you can get the chip and finish the job, I can clear your crimestat for you. What do you say?\n\nOf course, I don't know exactly how far they got, but I can tell you that the prison's got a whole network of hidden tunnels my guy was planning on using to make his escape. My guess is his corpse is rotting away somewhere there.\n\nOnce you find the body, I’m hoping the chip will still be on him. When you’ve got it, finish escaping and get the data to me. There’s a spot nearby you can upload the chip’s contents. \n\nOne warning though, you might want to watch out for Hurston Security. They've been a hassle lately, so I wouldn't be surprised if you ran into them.\n\nWhen I've got the data I’ll wipe your crimestat and then, voila, you’ll be free and clear.

Now the Nine Tails are willing to cut ties with the ship and its crew (who are probably all dead anyway), but they need a particular crate extracted. Guess it was a special order or something.\n\nAnyway, get aboard the October Rising, get the package, and get out.\n\nSecurity’s still hanging around so watch yourself and maybe bring some friends, but remember, your priority is the package. If you're looking to save yourself some extra hassle, you could also black out the area by shutting down the nearest comm array if you want to avoid the crimestats for, you know, killing a bunch of a security. But hey, you do you.\n\nOnce you’re out, drop the package off at the clinic on Grim HEX and I’ll sort your payment.\n\nEasy peasy,\n\nRuto

mg_ruto_commhack_danger_0001=You might run into some trouble out there. I trust you know how to handle that. 
mg_ruto_commhack_danger_0002=I'm not gonna lie. You may have to fight some people on this one. 
mg_ruto_commhack_danger_0003=Oh, one more thing. You might have to kill some people to pull this off. 
mg_ruto_commhack_danger_0004=Hope you're up for a scrap. This job's set to get nasty. 
mg_ruto_commhack_desc=~mission(desc)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0001=Some ~mission(gang) are looking to get CommArray ~mission(CommArray) taken offline. ~mission(rush)Don't care how it's done. Just needs to get done. Sort it out for them and you'll get a nice bonus. ~mission(threat) ~mission(time)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0002=Look, no one likes being monitored while they work, right? So all we're going to do is take down Array ~mission(CommArray) for a little while while some people do some work. ~mission(rush)We don't need to get into who's doing what or any of the other details, the important thing is that once it's offline, some credits are going to find their way into your account courtesy of some ~mission(gang). ~mission(Time)Sounds good, right? ~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0003=I just got paid to manufacture a blackout. Which means that you can get paid for executing one. It's fairly simple, head over to CommArray ~mission(CommArray) and shut it down. ~mission(time)~mission(rush)~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0004=I was contacted by some ~mission(gang) to provide a little privacy. Guess they have a job or something going down. Anyway, that's not for you. You are going to bring down CommArray ~mission(CommArray). ~mission(time)~mission(rush)Take it down and I'll pay you out. ~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_desc_0005=So it seems somebody wants to make an area less secure. Shocking, right? As a struggling businessman in these tough economic times, I am uncomfortable with such a request, but I feel obligated to my clients. Customer service is very important to me. Anyway, you'll need to gain entry to CommArray ~mission(CommArray) and shut it down. Just an FYI, the ~mission(gang) who are putting up the creds for this are VIP, so make sure it's done right. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)
mg_ruto_commhack_obj_long_01=Go to CommArray ~mission(CommArray).

mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0002=Gonna need this handled on the quick side too, if you get me. 
mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0003=Don't mess around. This has got to get done now. 
mg_ruto_commhack_rush_0004=You need to move quick on this one. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0001=One more thing though, you're gonna need to make sure it stays off for a while. The pros need time to work, if you get me. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0002=When it's done, I'm gonna need you to babysit the array. Make sure no do-gooders come and switch it back on. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0003=Here's the deal. Once the array's down, make sure it stays down. 
mg_ruto_commhack_time_0004=You'll need to stick around once the hack's done. I need that blackout sustained for a bit.

mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0001=You might run into a little trouble out there. I mean, that's fitting right? You are going out to find a body. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0002=And arm up. You're heading to a crime scene, you know. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0003=Keep an eye on your scans. There might be some unfriendly sorts out there. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_danger_0004=This might go without saying, you are hunting down a corpse after all, but there might be a bit of violence out on this job. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc=~mission(Desc)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0001=A bit of backstory on this one. Some random scav has been going around claiming that they offed a big time hitter by the name of ~mission(TargetName). Claims that they caught ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) right in the middle of pulling a job. Now the thing is, if ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) is really dead... well... that creates complications for the ~mission(Client). \n\nAnyway, after some careful negotiations from yours truly, they've coughed up some creds to pay for someone to go out and verify that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is actually dead. ~mission(Timed)You will just need to go to ~mission(Location), find the body and confirm. ~mission(Danger) 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0002=Here's a bit of dreadful business to throw your way. ~mission(Client) had a recent op that apparently turned into a total shitshow. Mayhem and carnage to the nth degree. Anyway, the rumor was that ~mission(TargetName) got clipped in the exchange, but now people are saying that the bastard's still alive. \n\nAnyway, the ~mission(Client) need to know one way or the other. That's why I'm having you go out to ~mission(Location) and confirm that they're a corpsicle. Once you get the ID, you get paid. ~mission(Danger)Pretty simple, right? ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0003=Everyone's been talking about ~mission(TargetName) recently. The ~mission(Client) have been saying that they were killed a few days ago in the middle of pulling a job for them, but... well, let's just say that they're a less than accurate source of information. Anyway, I've got a client who's eager to prove them wrong, so they're shelling out some creds to get a positive id on the body. I'll hook you up with the  ~mission(Location). You have a look and tell me if you find them. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0004=Got a simple, but kinda disgusting job here. In a recent raid, ~mission(TargetName)'s ticket got punched and I guess the ~mission(Client) want some proof of old ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst)'s remains for... something. I honestly don't know why. Maybe they're worried that the bastard is playing dead just to steal from them. Anyway, they gave me the  ~mission(Location) and are paying for someone to go out and confirm the kill. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)
mg_ruto_confirmkill_desc_0005=The ~mission(Client) hired a hitter to take out a rival who's been poaching on their turf, but between you and me, I guess they didn't really get their credits worth because the guy forgot to provide proof that ~mission(TargetName) was actually dead. Anyway, I told them I could provide that, and by that, I mean you could provide it. All you gotta do is go to  ~mission(Location) and confirm that ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst)'s touching void. ~mission(Danger)Once I get confirmation, you get paid. ~mission(Timed)

mg_ruto_confirmkill_timed_0002=Another thing, the clients would like to know now, so get to it. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_timed_0003=I don't really know how long bodies stick around for, so I'd recommend getting a move on. 
mg_ruto_confirmkill_timed_0004=You might want to move fast. God knows what's happening to that body right now.

mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0001=Odds are, anyone you come across won't be too pleased to see you. I trust you'll be able to handle them. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0002=I'm not anticipating this to be a smooth run though, so I'd make sure your guns are working. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0003=I'm not gonna lie. This one might get a little rough. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0004=Just gonna say, the last couple people I've sent on these runs have gotten tuned up, so stay sharpish. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_danger_0005=Might wanna get ready for a fight too. You never know. 
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc=~mission(Desc)
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0001=This one's gonna be a little tricky. The ~mission(Client) need someone to set up a ~mission(Item) so they can eavesdrop on the local suckers. You have to pick up the ~mission(Item) from ~mission(Location), set the thing up at ~mission(Destination) and get out. ~mission(Danger)Once it's up and running, you'll get your creds.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0002=Need someone to set up a snooping device for the ~mission(Client) and they're gonna pay well to make it happen. First you'll need to pick up a ~mission(Item). I think they got one set aside over at ~mission(Location). Anyway, whenever you've got one, make your way over to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Danger)You gotta set it up at the right spot or it won't work. Once the thing's running, get the hell out of there. Creds will be waiting when you're clear.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0003=~mission(Client) are paying for someone to drop a ~mission(Item) over at ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Danger)Pick up the ~mission(Item) from ~mission(Location) and get to it.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0004=You ever work with a ~mission(Item)? It's fairly simple stuff. Take it to an area, turn the thing on, and it taps into nearby comms. Nice little system if you're looking to dig up a little intel, maybe scout out a couple marks to hit. Anyway, I need one dropped at ~mission(Destination) for this thing I'm looking into and I need you to set it up. ~mission(Danger)Head over to ~mission(Location) and pick it up, they got one set aside for you. I'll transfer the credits once you got it active.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0005=I guess the ~mission(Client) are cooking up something big. They've requested a ~mission(Item) get set up over at ~mission(Destination). You'll need to grab one from ~mission(Location), head over and set it up. They're pretty self-explanatory, so don't sweat the set up. ~mission(Danger)\n\nAnyway, once you got the ~mission(Item) in place and active, get the hell out of there. I'll pay you after.
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_desc_0006=Got client who's looking to put some ears on ~mission(Destination). All you gotta do is head over to ~mission(Location), pick up a ~mission(Item) then go set it up. ~mission(Danger)Job ain't over until the ~mission(Item)'s up and running, so make sure it's safe and operational. Once they get the data stream, you get the creds. Simple, right?
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(Location).
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_obj_long_02=Collect the ~mission(Item).
mg_ruto_deploypiggyback_obj_long_03=Go to ~mission(Destination) to deploy ~mission(Item).

mg_ruto_distraction_analogy_002=I want you to make people think you're the second coming of Ivar Messar or... you know, one of the bad ones. 
mg_ruto_distraction_analogy_003=By the time you're done, I want your name to be a warning. 
mg_ruto_distraction_desc=~mission(description)
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0001=I have to say, this might be one of the best plans I've ever come up with. See, the ~mission(client) are looking to pull off the job of the century, but no way they'd get away clean. That is of course, unless there's something even bigger going down at the same time. You're gonna be the something bigger. I'm talking chaos on a whole new scale. \n\n~mission(wanted)With that nasty of a reputation, all you have to do is go visit a ~mission(Location) in the area and shoot at everything that shows up. I'll even tip off the authorities so they know exactly where you are. I figure with all the noise you'll be making, no way anyone gives two shits about what the ~mission(client) are up to.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0002=This is the sort of job most scavers only dream about getting paid for. How often do you get paid to make as big of a mess as you can?\n\n~mission(wanted)Between the bounty on your head, and me telling everyone where to find you, you should have about every ship in the sector on your ass in seconds. I figure we'll have you make your stand at a ~mission(Location) and I'll make sure word gets out on where to find you. Then all you have to do is keep them occupied for as long as you can. \n\nOf course, you're probably wondering why you're doing all this. While I can't tell you the details, let's just say that the ~mission(client) are going to be very appreciative for you keeping all the security forces occupied.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0003=The ~mission(client) are gonna pay you to unleash as much hell as you can in the sector. ~mission(wanted)You show up at a ~mission(Location) guns blazing, I put the word out on the spec, and just like that, everybody is looking the other way while the real job is going down. Classic misdirection.
mg_ruto_distraction_desc_0004=You know how I normally want my people to keep a low profile? Well, not this time. The ~mission(client) need you to tie up every bit of law in the sector. Make them so busy they won't notice anything else going on. I'm talking next level destruction. ~mission(analogy)~mission(wanted)\n\nEven better is I'll tip off everyone before hand so they know exactly where to find you. I'm thinking a ~mission(Location) since those are usually patrolled to begin with. Then all that's left is for you to take down as many of the bastards as you can. Should make headlines on the spec for weeks.
mg_ruto_distraction_obj_Marker_02=~mission(Location)

mg_ruto_distraction_title_0004=all eyes on you
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_001=To make sure that they're paying attention, you're gonna have to get yourself to crimestat 5 and stay there. Only way to guarantee that every security hack and bounty hunter in the sector is gonna be making eyes at you. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_002=Here's the real fun part. In order to pull this off, I need you to get a level 5 crimestat. Hack a comm array, kill a bunch of people. I don't really care how. Just get to level 5 and stay there. That way there's no chance they're gonna be able to ignore a dangerous criminal such as yourself. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_003=Now, the reason I wanted you for this job specifically is cause of your crimestat level. Only a level 5 like yourself is a big enough threat to pull the kind of heat I'm talking about. Just do me a favor and make sure you stay at a 5 till this is all over. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_004=Plus, with your crimestat at a 5, you're the ideal candidate to pull this job off. Everyone within the system will be beating each other senseless to get a crack at taking you down. It's perfect. As long as you stay a level 5 that is. 
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_005=In order for this to work, you're gonna need to have a crimestat 5. That's the only way to make sure every security hack and bounty hunter in the sector is gonna be making eyes at you. Now, as it happens, I'm plugged directly into the system's ECN, so once you take the gig, I'll make you notorious.
mg_ruto_distraction_wanted_006=The catch is you gotta instantly become the system's most wanted to get the kinda heat we want all focused on you. Fortunately, I got myself a backdoor into your criminal files to make that happen. All you gotta do is say yes and your crimestat goes through the roof, then you just focus on raising some hell out there.

mg_ruto_havejob_title_0007=let's talk
mg_ruto_havejob_title_0008=got something for you
mg_ruto_intromission_desc=~mission(Description)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0001=Hi there. I've been hearing your name pop up a lot recently on security channels. Seems you're pretty hell bent on making life difficult for those authority types. I'll be honest. I like that kind of initiative. I know some people who might be interested in subsidizing your anti-social habits. But I'm getting ahead of myself. \n\nI'd like to see how you operate in the field myself, so here's the deal, the ~mission(Client) have pushed someone into the sweet hereafter and have paid for someone to make the remains disappear. That's considerate, right? No sense letting trash like that stink up ~mission(Location01). Anyway, I'd like you to go there, collect the boxes and dispose of them. Don't really care where as long as it's off-world and not in front of some cops. Simple, right? Anyway, you do this and we can talk about further, more lucrative, employment opportunities. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0002=You're becoming quite popular among the unsavories. My name's Ruto. You've probably heard of me. I'm a sort of talent scout for unsavories myself and I'm pretty good at it, if I say so. Part of the reason for that is standards. Not a lot of people have 'em. Me, I need to know that when I give a job to one of my people, that they'll execute it. Otherwise, it's just chaos, you know? But the bad kind. \n\nAnyway, I think we might be able to help each other out. First though, I need to see you in action for myself. The ~mission(Client) ghosted some idiot down at ~mission(Location01) and need the packaged up remains disposed of. Feels like something you could handle, no? Knock this out and maybe we can talk more. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_desc_0003=Why hello. Been watching you for a while now. Not in a creepy way or anything, more like professional curiosity. See, I make it my business to know who's making moves in my system. If I see someone with potential, let's just say, I bring them into the fold. \n\nAnyway, I think you might be the kinda person I should know better. But first, I've got a little job for you. Something simple to show me that you're not one of these lazy kids I see on the spectrum. That you're a real go-getter. \n\nThere's remains of a body down at ~mission(Location01). I won't tell you who did it or why. Only that the boxes need to get gone. Take them off-world somewhere and dump it. You do that and maybe I can fill you in on all the exciting opportunities available to an entrepreneurial go-getter like yourself. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(location)
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_long_02=Collect the body.
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_long_03=Get rid of the corpse off-world.

mg_ruto_intromission_obj_short_01=Go to pickup site
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_short_02=Collect body
mg_ruto_intromission_obj_short_03=Dump body
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0001=Need to take care of this quick though. Sorry. Hate to rush, but you know, clients are paying.
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0002=Oh, I'll need you to sort this out on the quicker side.
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0003=One more thing, you'll need to hurry. Clients want this handled now.
mg_ruto_intromission_timed_0004=Yeah, probably should mention that I need this taken care of immediately, so off you go.

mg_ruto_invite_desc=~mission(description)
mg_ruto_invite_desc_0001=You handled yourself pretty well. I suppose it's time we meet up and make this official. Sound good? I'm working out of this old tech shop on Grim HEX called Technotic. Just come on in and find me in the back. ~mission(oldman) Anyway, swing by when you can.
mg_ruto_invite_desc_0002=Thanks for taking care of that little job for me. Hope it wasn't too messy. Anyway, as promised, I'd like to invite you down and see if we can't work out a little arrangement. If you're interested, head on over to Grim HEX. Somewhere in the back halls, you'll find a run down little hole called Technotic. I'm in the back. ~mission(oldman)
mg_ruto_invite_desc_0003=I think it's about time we talked about your future. Don't you think? You ever been to Grim HEX before? Nasty little corner of nothing in the field above Yela. Swing on by and look for a tech shop called Technotic. I'm in the back. ~mission(oldman) Anyway, we'll have a little chat about your future, yeah? See if we can help each other out.
mg_ruto_invite_obj_long_01=Meet with Ruto in Grim HEX
mg_ruto_invite_obj_marker_01=Ruto
mg_ruto_invite_obj_short_01=Meet with Ruto
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_001=Don't mind the guy at the front. He's kinda like a watch dog. Just older... and quieter.
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_002=Whatever you do. Don't piss off the guy at the front. He may not look like much, but he's an ex-Marine.
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_003=Word of warning, the guy I have guarding the counter is violent. Real violent. If you see him wearing green, run. That's his trigger color.
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_004=Make sure the guy in the front doesn't talk your ear off.
mg_ruto_invite_oldman_005=Don't worry about the antique at the front counter. He came with the place.

mg_ruto_outpost_repair_DIY_0002=my old roommate trying to make his own quantum fuel
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_DIY_0003=the time this banger I ran with rigged his gun to be autofire and nearly destroyed his ship
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_DIY_0004=this old miner who figured she could build herself a better EVA suit.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0001=The longer they're dark, the more credits we lose. Need them up and running ASAP. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0002=A lot of people are waiting on them to be up and running again, so basically, hurry the hell up with this. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0003=A lot of credits run through the place which makes this repair pretty damn urgent. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0004=Some other jobs I got cooking are waiting on this being taken care of and I don't like being kept waiting. Faster you get this done the better. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_danger_0005=Not to rush you or anything, but this needs to get taken care of fast. 
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc=~mission(Desc)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0001=Normally people in our rarified profession don't mind working in the shadows, but having zero power is a bit much. It's even starting to hurt the operations down over at ~mission(Destination). See if you can go sort them out with a new battery, okay? ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0002=A storm down surface side a little while back caused some damage and now ~mission(Destination) doesn't have any power at all. Can't really afford to have them down for long, so I need you to bring them a replacement battery. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0003=Some wingnut over at ~mission(Destination) tried fixing an electrical problem on their own and now the whole outpost doesn't have power. Got to love that DIY attitude. I'm having flashbacks to ~mission(DIY). ~mission(Timed)Anyway, do me a favor and run a battery down there.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0004=I'm hoping you have some maintenance experience, because I need someone to bring a replacement battery down to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)And if anyone's there when you show up, don't let them talk you into cleaning up or anything. The contract is just for the battery.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_desc_0005=Got word from ~mission(Destination) that they've gone dark. Not sure what the hell they're doing there, but this is like the fifth time they've lost power this month. Probably trying to run a hot tub or something off the gennie. Either way, gonna need you to bring them a replacement battery. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_obj_long_01=Acquire replacement battery.
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_obj_long_02=Go to ~mission(Location).
mg_ruto_outpost_repair_obj_long_03=Restore power to ~mission(Location).

mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc=~mission(Description)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0001=There was an 'accident' and now there's a couple of boxes of remains where they shouldn't be. ~mission(Client) need a cleaner to cart them off-world. ~mission(Timed)And don't tell me what you do with them. It's probably better if I don't know.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0002=The ~mission(Client) had a change of leadership and their former manager's been made redundant right through the eyes. Now they need someone to "clear out the desk," so to speak, and dump everything off-world. ~mission(Timed)Really makes me appreciate being self-employed.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0003=Bit of a going away party / funeral that I want you to attend. The guest of honor needs a ride off-world and you're gonna give it to 'em. Dead bastard really should have known better than to skim from the ~mission(Client). ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0004=Guess there was a bit of a disagreement between a couple of ~mission(Client) that got pretty heated. Anyway, they need someone to escort whatever's left of the losing side off the premises. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_desc_0005=One of the big truths in this 'verse is that dead bodies seldom go anywhere on their own. That's why the ~mission(Client) need us to move one for them. I'm sure you can figure out somewhere suitably private to take the remains. ~mission(Timed)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(Location01|Address). 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_obj_long_02=Collect all boxes containing remains and remove them from the site.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0002=The ~mission(Client) are a little on edge about the remains just sitting out there. I've told them there's nothing to worry about, but let's go ahead and take care of this as fast as possible. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0003=We need to hurry up and take care of this before before someone starts poking around. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0004=Gonna call this a rush job. Remain are not going anywhere, but the ~mission(Client) will feel a lot better once everything's been taken care of. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_body_timed_0005=Don't take too long on this. Last thing we need is for someone else to get to the remains before you do.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0001=This is a simple delivery run. Pick up a box of ~mission(drug) from ~mission(location) and take it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0002=Short and sweet. You're gonna head to~mission(location) and pick up a shipment of ~mission(drug). Make sure you keep a low profile and run it to ~mission(destination)". Simple. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)One more thing. This is for the ~mission(client), so don't screw it up.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0003=Word's come down that the ~mission(client) need some product moved from ~mission(location) and delivered to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)Hopefully I don't need to reiterate this, but don't even think about sampling the supply.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0004=Apparently there's been a high demand for ~mission(drug), so the ~mission(client) need to re-up their dealers. You're gonna head down to ~mission(location), pick up the package and take it to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_desc_0005=Here you go. Like I said, it's a pretty straightforward job. ~mission(client) need some ~mission(drug) grabbed from ~mission(location) and taken to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)You do this right and not only will you stay in my good graces, you'll make some nice creds as well. Seems fair, right? ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_rush_0001=This job comes with a timetable, so I'm gonna need you to move quick on this. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_rush_0002=Hurry up too. I'm told the masses are eager for their party favors. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_rush_0003=You'll be on a clock with this one. The~mission(client) need their supply quick.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_trouble_0002=A little bird told me that there might be some heavies out gunning for this job too. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_trouble_0003=You might need to fight some people on this one. Just so you know. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_drug_trouble_0004=Be ready for a scrap. I'm not expecting this one to go smoothly. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0001=Make sure you bring some guns. There's a high potentiality that this one might get a little rough. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0002=There's a good chance you might need to kill some people on this one. I trust you don't have a problem with that. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0003=And keep your eyes open. Word is there are predators circling, if you get my meaning. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0004=You don't mind killing people right? I'm not promising anything, but you might want to make sure you got some guns. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_danger_0005=Guy I know said that this job might've been shopped around before it landed with me, so there might be some unfriendly competition out there. Handle them. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc=~mission(desc)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0001=~mission(client) need a ~mission(item) transported from ~mission(location) and dropped at ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0002=You know how to move a box, right? This is right up your alley then. Pick up a ~mission(item) at ~mission(location) and run it over to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)Get it done right and the ~mission(client) cut you some creds. Simple. ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0003=We've been hired by the ~mission(client) to move some cargo. Now, they didn't tell me what's in the box and you're going to be paid not to care. All you gotta do is snag the ~mission(item) from ~mission(location) and get it to ~mission(destination) in one piece. ~mission(rush)~mission(threat) \n\nOh, do me a favor and don't look inside, okay? 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0004=As far as gigs go, they don't get much more basic than this. All you gotta do is go to ~mission(location) and snag a ~mission(item). Once you got it, take it over to ~mission(destination) and dump it. That's it. Seriously. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0005=This is a a straight cargo run. The ~mission(item) needs to get from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)This is a job for the ~mission(client), so don't screw it up.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_desc_0006=Got a simple run for you. Well... it should be pretty simple. ~mission(client) need a ~mission(item) moved from ~mission(location) to ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)~mission(threat)Get the ~mission(item) there in one piece and you get paid. Like I said, simple.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(location).

mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_rush_0003=Hurry up on this one. There are people waiting. 
mg_ruto_planetcollect_steal_rush_0004=If you do this job, make sure you take care of it quick.

mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc=~mission(Description)
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0001=Here's the deal. Some people I know have some ~mission(Item) that needs disposing of. I know. I know. Not exactly the type of work you dreamed of doing, but creds are creds, right? Times like these, people should be grateful for anything that comes their way. All you gotta do is pick up the ~mission(Item) and dump it off-world. Don't care where, but maybe not in front of some cops.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0002=Kind of a basic run. Not really worth your talents, but hey, a gig's a gig, right? All you gotta do is pick up some ~mission(Item) and get rid of it. That's it.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0003=Need you to swing by one of my clients and take away some ~mission(Item). They're paying to get it off-site and off-world, but don't care what happens after that, so neither do I. Do it and you'll get paid.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0004=Looks like a friend needs some ~mission(Item) disposed of without any questions. Head there, grab the ~mission(Item) and dump it off-world. They don't come much simpler.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0005=Hope you don't mind getting your hands dirty. I'm serious. This isn't a metaphor. There's some ~mission(Item) that needs to get dumped. Head on over and they should have it all boxed up and waiting for you to get off-world. One time contract. Standard pay.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_desc_0006=This here's a quick one. Shouldn't be too much trouble. There's some ~mission(Item) that needs to disappear. Pick it up, dump it off, get paid.
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_obj_long_01=Go to ~mission(Location01|Address).
mg_ruto_planetcollect_waste_obj_long_02=Collect all ~mission(Item).

mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_001=And I don't know if they've been doing some special training, or if they changed what they've been feeding the bastards, but some of these security pilots aren't half bad at fighting. Make sure you go in ready. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_002=Now, if this was a one on one, I'd put my credits on you hands down, but since these sec-jobs tend to travel in packs, clearing them out may end up being a pretty tough fight. Not trying to scare you off, just think you should know what you're in for. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_003=Be good to teach these corporate guns that standing up to the ~mission(client) doesn't pay. However hard they fight - and trust me, they're gonna fight - you fight back even harder. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_danger_004=Of course, as much as we make fun of these security hacks, don't underestimate them. Any idiot with a gun can kill you if you get sloppy. 
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc=~mission(description)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0001=~mission(contractor) have gone ahead and started poking around somewhere they shouldn't. You're gonna make them stop. Head out to ~mission(location) and clear every last one of those advocacy-wannabes from along their patrol route. ~mission(danger)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0002=Seems ~mission(contractor) has started patrolling out over in ~mission(location) by some of the ~mission(client)' territory. They'd normally take care of it themselves but since they've got something bigger in the works that they'd rather not risk, decided to hire an outsider to sweep the area clear. ~mission(danger)Last thing, try not to let any of them escape. It's not really professional, you know?
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0003=The ~mission(client) have a score all lined up, but they can't do anything about because some over-achieving ~mission(contractor) lugs are patrolling ~mission(location). Need you to fly along the route and take out any security you find. ~mission(danger)
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0004=I tried to warn them, but the ~mission(client) got overeager and now, thanks to them attacking too many civies, ~mission(contractor)'s stepping up patrols through ~mission(location). Gotten so bad they can't do business as long as security's there. That's where we come in. You're going to fly the patrol route and sweep it clean. ~mission(danger)Honestly though, I think you're gonna have a lot of fun with this one.
mg_ruto_sectorsweep_desc_0005=Despite the best efforts of myself and the other criminally-minded individuals in this sector, ~mission(contractor) is still trying to clean the place up. They even started patrolling out in ~mission(location). Can you believe it? There's no way we're gonna let that kind of initiative stand, so that's why you're going to fly along this patrol and clear them the hell out. ~mission(danger)

mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0002=Anyone messes with you, you drop them, yeah? 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0003=Another thing, this'll take you in some rough parts of space. I'd recommend guns. Lots of guns. 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0004=You know, looking at the ~mission(ship)'s position, I'm thinking you might wanna make sure your guns are all charged up. 
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_danger_0005=One of my people told me the ~mission(client) might've shopped this job around, so you may run into some trouble.

mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0001=A ~mission(ship) got punched out while on the drift. ~mission(client) are paying for someone to go out and pull a ~mission(item) from the wreck. ~mission(trouble)Once you get it, they want it dropped over at ~mission(destination).

mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0002=I'll keep this simple. I need you to extract a ~mission(item) from the corpse of a ~mission(ship) and leave it at ~mission(destination). ~mission(rush)The ~mission(client) passed along the location of ~mission(location). ~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0003=~mission(client) are hiring. They want someone to head out to ~mission(location) and snag a ~mission(item) from the wreck. I don't know if they killed the ~mission(ship) and I don't really care. Once you got the ~mission(item), just take it over to ~mission(destination) and drop it off. ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0004=This is that gig I was telling you about. Seems pretty casual, if you ask me, but I don't have to go out there. Anyway, ~mission(client) want someone to pull a ~mission(item) from a ~mission(ship) corpse and run it over to ~mission(destination). ~mission(trouble)That's it. ~mission(rush)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0005=I know how much love crawling around the wreckage of a ~mission(ship) so I saved this one just for you. And guess what, the ~mission(client) will even pay you for it. All you gotta do is snag a ~mission(item) while you're out there and take it to ~mission(destination). I'll send you the details on ~mission(location). ~mission(rush)~mission(trouble)
mg_ruto_spacecargo_illegal_desc_0006=I'm gonna include the exact job request from the ~mission(client) in its entirety just so you can see what I have to deal with:\n\nhy Ruta, my offaz an i went an downed a ~mission(ship) off in the black. bozz wanna boxes from it but didnt tell us. we three bottlz inna night and needin someone to go grab it. i sendin creds for it. \n\nI just don't know how some of these idiots stay alive as long as they do, much less fly a spaceship.

mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0001=Here's the deal, got a tip from ~mission(Contractor|StealNickname) that some skag named ~mission(TargetName) got real ambitious and snagged a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from some suckers. That's all well and good, but it seems that they owe some creds to the ~mission(client) and have been refusing to use their newfound wealth to settle up. Now, the ~mission(client) want someone to ghost 'em and retrieve the ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) from the wreck. That way, they get their money back and remind any future idiots that they gotta pay their debts. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) Once you get the goods, drop them off at ~mission(destination) and get paid. ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger)

mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0003=Here's that robbery I was telling you about.

Pay's coming down from ~mission(client), so make sure you deliver.
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0005=~mission(client) are paying for someone to knock over ~mission(TargetName)'s ship and steal a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem). Contract's very specific that they got to go. No bargains, no mercy, just one to the dome and a trip to their cargo hold. Take the stuff to ~mission(destination) and get paid. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger)
mg_ruto_spacesteal_desc_0006=Friend of mine said that ~mission(nickname) was posted up in Old38 wasted out of their mind, bragging about how ~mission(TargetName) had scored a ~mission(Contractor|StealItem) that was, and I quote, 'valuable as hell.' Now, I floated this tidbit out to the sharks and the ~mission(client) were the most interested. They're willing to pay for you to head out, track down ~mission(TargetName|Last)'s ship and snatch the loot. Once you do, run it over to ~mission(destination) and drop it off. ~mission(client) will transfer the creds once they get it. ~mission(Contractor|StealTimed) ~mission(Contractor|StealDanger) I think we've all learned a valuable lesson about the dangers of bragging, haven't we?

I've gotten approval to contract independent operators as temporary security personnel to guard these terminals against unauthorized access. If you subdue any trespassers, we will provide additional compensation as hazard pay.\n\nIf you accept this position, we will provide you with the equipment to complete your job. Please understand that you will have to stay on-site for the duration of your shift. Should an emergency arise before your shift is over, you just need to resign your post at the security office before leaving.

It's not exactly the easiest station to get into since Crusader Security started using it as an evidence lock up and there's officers crawling all over the place, but beggars can’t be choosers, right?\n\nJust grab a cryptokey (Technotics in Grim HEX might be able to set you up), sneak or fight your way into Kareah, hack the criminal database, and just like that, no more crimestat ratings.

mission_Gamescom2017_Blackbox_Description=ECKHART SECURITY, LLC.\nCONTRACTS & DISPATCH\n\nCONTRACT TYPE: Retrieval\nCONTRACTOR STATUS: Independent\nAPPROVAL CODE: ME-01\n\nFOR IMMEDIATE PROCESSING\n\nA government witness was being transported across the system to testify in the trial of a major Syndicate Boss when their transport was shot down. The lawyers want to prove that they were targeted by Syndicate assassins, so they’re paying good money to retrieve the black box which recorded the crime. Unfortunately, it’s highly likely that if the Syndicate did organize the hit, they’ll be sending people to retrieve the black box to wipe the data, so you’ll have to hurry.\n\nPayment will be issued upon successful completion of contract.\n\nThis contract is non-negotiable.\n\nThis message may contain confidential, proprietary, privileged and/or private information.

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_01_Text=LAST UPDATED: 2945-03-21_16:44SET\n\nOn 2945-03-03 we received our first report of missing BIG BENNY brand vending machines from the Port Olisar commuter hub station. Alby Mollion, the on call manager, explained that a TERRA MILLS SERVICE TECHNICIAN had come to repair the machine and informed him that it would have to be taken to an offsite center. The following week, shift supervisor Tony Losong contacted Terra Mills Service Center to inquire about the repair only to learn that the so-called service technician had not in fact been associated with the company. It was at this point that Crusader Security was contacted by the Port Olisar administrators to look into the matter. Security vids pulled from the station’s feed captured the suspect leaving with the machine in question but so far, facial match has been a dead end. It is surmised that the suspect was wearing spoofs, faux-vis, or some combination thereof. Attempts to track the suspect’s transport also proved futile as the regtags were traced back to a decommissioned hauler. \n\nOn 2945-03-05, we received a second report from CryAstro station 1267SC where their Big Benny unit was also taken under the guise of repair. Not long after, dozens of similar reports from other stations around the Crusader sector began to trickle in, stating that a false Terra Mills technician had removed their Big Benny machines. Those separate reports were vetted and indexed under this main casefile once the connection was confirmed. \n\nIn the meanwhile, we have been working with Terra Mills to issue a general warning to all Big Benny machine owners to be on the lookout for unscheduled service technicians and that they should always demand to see credentials. An image of the suspect has likewise been circulated. However, since 2945-03-12 there have been no further reports.\nIn attempt to track down the culprit we have notified scrap yards and secondhand sellers to alert us if someone tries to offer a Big Benny unit for sale. We have also tasked Terra Mills with tracing unusual refill orders surmising that the stolen machines may eventually require more Kacho to be stocked. \n\n**EDIT 2945-03-21 ** We did have a possible hit on the VSS we put out on the suspect’s transport, but reached a dead end after we lost the trail near Grim HEX. We currently don’t have the resources to investigate directly, but I have put in a request for a CI to follow up.\n\n

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_AboveAndBeyond_Subtitle=Crusader Visitor Information Center
mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_AboveAndBeyond_Text=Millions of people from around the Empire come to visit Crusader every year. From stunning vistas planetside to a bevy of unique and memorable locations in the surrounding environs, there’s plenty of reasons why Crusader is considered by many to be “Above and Beyond.”\n\nWhat better way to explore the grand expanses of the Crusader than by riding aboard a Genesis Starliner that was built planetside by Crusader Industries. These luxurious cruise ships offer tours of not only the gorgeous upper atmosphere of Crusader proper, but offer a myriad of options and destinations. Why not start with a sunset tour to see a Genesis being built right before your eyes in the beautiful latticework of Crusader Industries; expansive shipyards? From there you can cruise along to the lower atmosphere to experience the colorful cacophony of one of our famous “light storms” or head out into orbit to visit the beautiful icy moon of Yela. Named for the oldest sibling in the childhood favorite fairy tale “A Gift for Baba,” a visit to this frozen landscape will surely have all the makings of a tale of your own.\n  \nFor more information on tickets and timetables, or to learn more about places to see and visit during your stay, please contact the Crusader Visitor Information Center.

mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_Artists_Subtitle=Personal Datapad - Dreams, Thoughts, and Inspiration
mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_Artists_Text=/**MOBICONNECT.RETRIEVALSYSTEM.FRP…DATAFOUND**/\n\n•	Remember, this is a free flowing expression of your thoughts. Don’t hold back. Don’t edit. Be true and you will find truth.\n\n•	Impact over substance or transformation over rehabilitation?\n\n•	The medium is part of discussion as much as the discussion itself is a medium of the art, but when that message overcomes the piece, is that the ultimate goal? Should the work stand or topple? Stop to ask ‘what if’ but make sure the remaining question is always why.\n\n•	Found another critique - “Though the work is an assault on the space, there remains little bite behind the attack. The only kindness in the experience is that the all the leftover resin has been promised to a local art school. Hopefully it may find use as art yet.” This is what I need. This pain. \n\n•	While I had some concerns at first, I am thrilled that my new hab is proving a fruitful ground for inspiration. Leaving the comfortable familiar behind and embracing the chaos of Grim HEX has been so cathartic I have begun to count losing all my credits as a blessing. \n\n•	You see these other artists who “make it.” Denara with his looms lapping up the critic’s praise, or Tamsa and her painted ships. Their embracing of the commercialization of art is the very poison that is destroying our souls. To expose how deep this commoditization of Humanity would be a true work of inspiration.\n\n•	I watched an ambush today outside the base. It was thrilling and terrifying at the same time, but it was the aftermath that struck me the most. The silence after the predators had flown away, stripping the cargo of their prey, I found myself transfixed by the drifting hulk of the wreck. The twisted shapes losing all function and becoming pure form. Definitely a motif to be explored further. \n\n•	I met a woman today who goes by the name Threetoe. She told me that if she was to die she’d want to be floated out in the asteroids by ‘the Big Sister.” She explained how her mother used to read the ‘A Gift for Baba’ to her growing up and she always related to the character. It amazes me the impact these stories of our youth can shape our very being. What replaces them as we grow older? The stories stop, but the need persists. What are the fairy tales that give us comfort now? The answer came to me as my thoughts were interrupted by cries of “So Yum, So Wow” from a nearby Big Benny’s machine. This is how the story of Humanity will be told. This corrupt consumerism will be the monument that we leave behind. \n\n•	A monument for me to leave behind …\n\n
mobiGlas_MissingBennysDatapad_Artists_Title=INSTALLATION 3 – IDEATION JOURNAL
mobiGlas_MissingBennys_Artist_mobi_Text=/**MOBICONNECT.RETRIEVALSYSTEM.FRP…DATAFOUND**/\n\nThe project is nearly finished. It's been a hard installation but the wonderful fatigue of my body is the most alive I have felt in months.  It took me all day, but I think I figured out how to fix the machine I've been having trouble balancing. Once I get that done, only two more to go. Nothing like overcoming challenges to reinvigorate the soul.\n\nI can feel in every essence of my being just how important this work will be.\n\nThe questions remains though, what is the best way to reveal this unprecedented work to humanity? Do I stay silent to allow the naturally curious be the chosen few, spreading the gospel of Benny until the masses descend upon the site eager to know real truth? Or do I anonymously message an art critic or two to help them along the way? \n\nIt is almost tempting to stay here and await their arrival just to see what their reaction will be.\n

mobiglas_AlphaStation_WelcomeMessage_BodyText=On behalf of our entire staff and Crusader Industries, thank you for choosing Port Olisar for your visit to the Crusader area. We realize that there are many fine stations available, so we sincerely appreciate your business and look forward to providing an enjoyable experience.\n\nWe would like to call your attention to two important services:\n\n*Accessing Your Ship*\nIf you arrived at the station in a personal craft, Port Olisar is proud to feature UniCorp Limited’s cutting edge all-in-one automated ship organization program, ASOP. To retrieve your vessel, visit one of the ASOP terminals located in the Ship Deck, and once selected, your ship will be delivered to an available landing pad. \n\n*Safety Protocols*\nFor the safety of our guests, Port Olisar has been declared an Armistice Zone. Combat is prohibited and the use of all personal and ship weapons is strictly limited. If you would like more information about the Armistice Initiative, please contact a staff member or visit the Advocacy on the spectrum.\n\nAlso, please note that Port Olisar and the area above Crusader are a UEE Monitored zone. Our Comm Arrays are linked to the UEE’s Emergency Communication Network (ECN) and, when operational, will alert authorities immediately if you are involved in an accident, crime or life-threatening situation. While traveling, please maintain an active CommLink to ensure continued usage of the ECN.\n\nAnd of course, feel free to take advantage of our other top-class amenities:\n\n*Big Benny’s Kacho-To-Go*\nWhenever you’re in the mood to “Grab Eat,” make sure to check out our Big Benny’s Kacho-To-Go vending unit featuring the original noodle recipe made famous on Lo and their new spicy Mathania Red variety!\n\n*EZHab Rest Area*\nWhatever the length of your stay, take a moment to relax in our comfortable and private EZHab sleeping accommodations available for rent. \n\n*Complimentary Shuttles*\nIf your travel plans include a trip to Crusader’s surface, Port Olisar offers daily complimentary shuttles to Platinum Bay landing park in Orison; featuring breathtaking views of Crusader Industries’ famous construction yards. For schedule information, please contact a staff member. \n\nIf there is anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable please do not hesitate to ask any member of our staff or myself. We would be delighted to help you. \n\nWith kindest regards,\nSelma Hoss\n\nManaging Director\nPort Olisar Station, Crusader, Stanton\n

mobiglas_Alpha_Aciedo_Contract_Body=We are looking to immediately hire temporary contract system technicians to assist in the maintenance of Comm Arrays located near Crusader. Previous experience a plus. Arrays require a hard reset so experience with EVA in a hazardous environment is a must.
mobiglas_Alpha_Aciedo_Contract_Title=Temporary Contract Position: Comm Technician
mobiglas_Alpha_Crusader_CommsWarning_Body=We wish to notify you that you may experience difficulties with your comm system while traveling in the vicinity of Crusader. We apologize for the inconvenience. Our security teams are currently working to correct this issue and have the errant Arrays reconnected soon.\n\nPlease note, this outage also compromises the Emergency Communications Network grid, so security forces will be unable to respond in the event of a ship malfunction or criminal activity. We highly recommend adjusting your flight plan accordingly.\n\nCrusader Industries thanks you for your patience in this matter,\n\nLorenzo Momar\nVice President, Interstellar Communications Division, Crusader Industries

I just got the estimate from the repair crew. It’s not good. The whole air filter system is going to need to be replaced and that’s going to take some time. Not to mention getting the extra expenditure cleared by Central is going to be a bit of a to-do after the struggle we had getting the last increase through the board.\n\nI’m afraid there is no way we can proceed with opening the station as planned, and, unless you object, I’m going to keep the patrols operating out of their existing posts and delay their transfers until we have a better grasp on the updated timeline.\n\nNot going to lie, it's a major setback. I know how much having this new facility operating meant to you. Darston and myself are going to do everything we can to help get us back on track. \n\nSee you tomorrow,\nPauline\n\nPauline Nesso\n\nFacilities Manager\nCrusader Security\nSecurity Post Kareah

We are sorry to inform you that after careful consideration and review, our investigation has revealed the cause of loss is not covered by the employee policy provided by Covalex Shipping.\n\nPersonal Life Policy 02107 02012000 notes the following exclusions under which benefits will not be paid if the loss:\n\n(A)	results from the Insured's alcoholism or addiction to drugs or narcotics; but not addiction which results from the administration of those substances in accordance with the advice and written instructions of a Licensed Health Care Practitioner.\n(B)	results from the Insured's participation in a felony, riot or insurrection, or involvement in an illegal occupation.\n\nThe preponderance of the evidence collected at Covalex Gundo Station and witness statements indicate that the insured was intoxicated to the point they he lost normal control of his mental and physical facilities and that this intoxication was a contributing cause of the accident.\n\nIt is against the law and considered a felony for an individual to cause the death of another by the operation of devices while under the influence of intoxicants. Even if there may be intervening factors between the fact of operation and the death of another. Felony exclusion makes no benefits payable. \n\nSince your claim was denied, you have the right to an internal appeal. You may request one by filling out a DCR-90 form. If you have questions regarding the information contained in this letter, please feel free to contact our claims department. \n\nSincerely,\n\nJessie Holzburg\n\nClaims Adjuster\nImperial General Insurance

It's ridiculous. There is no way that's true. I know my husband. Darnell had his problems but that's all in the past.\n\nI want you to go Covalex and send me evidence that my husband is innocent. But even if you find out he isn't, you'll still get paid. I know your time is valuable and really, I just want to know the truth.\n \nGood luck, and I hope to hear from you soon one way or another.

Needs to be more detail focused. One more strike? \n- Does a lot to help maintain crew morale. \n\nDarnell Ward Notes: \n- Was a little abrasive at first when he came back, but has settled back into a solid routine. Once in a while still have to remind him about watching his attitude. \n- Punctuality problems seemed to have gone away. Has been on time regularly for past 3 months. \n- Keeps personal space clean. \n- Can sometimes be too diligent in trying to figure out a problem. Over thinks things sometimes which means tasks can take a little longer than expected. \n- Also can lead to taking unnecessary risks. \n- Very proactive though. Will address issues without needing to be told to do so. \n\nNico Theolone Notes: \n- Very focused. \n- Gets job done. \n- Figure out how to mention deodorant thing??? \n\nKiyomi Santos Notes: \n- So far so good. Seems to be stepping into the position well. \n- Good attitude. \n- Reports could be a little cleaner. Have noticed a few typos and errors. Simple things. Should take the time to double check before filing. \n- Schedule rotation suggestion was a good one. \n- Possible candidate for advanced training \n\nMel Ososky Notes: \n- Needs to be more mindful of using mobiGlas during work hours. \n- Has helped to improve the distro rate. Moving more crates through thanks to oversight on the cargo manifests. \n- Can be territorial with responsibilities. Needs to be more willing to let others help. \n\nSelf Eval Notes: \n- Need to be better about respecting that personal hours. I have sometimes taken advantage of employees living onsite and it can blur the lines between on and off hours. Downtime is important. \n- Profits have exceeded the 3% growth mandated by Covalex, in large part to my management. \n- Employee retention has increased. Turnover rate has significantly dropped. \n- Need to be better about following up on things earlier. Don't assume employees are tracking deadlines.

murderspree_desc=~mission(DistractionKillDescription|Description)
murderspree_desc_0001=I got a bit of a sob story for you. Year ago to the day, Navy squad came and dusted some of my best. Spaced 'em in the middle of a job with nary a warnin'. Hardly seems right. \n\nNow I'm thinkin' it's about time to settle the score. Heard that there was a level 5 in system and it's too good of a chance to pass up. See, as long as your crimestat's that high, the brave little starmen are gonna be huntin' you down anytime security gets wind of ya. Here's what I say, let 'em. \n\nEvery one of them blues that comes to hunt you, you take them out first. Get ~mission(KillCount) of them and I figure that'll be justice for my crew and a fine payout for you.   \n\nOne little bit extra - once you land the first shot, I need you to do it all in a set amount of time: ~mission(KillTime). The same as it took them to wipe us out. Call me sentimental. 
murderspree_desc_0002=Since you're a level 5, I'm assuming you're one crazy bastard. Exactly the type I need to settle a bet I have going. \n\nMy idiot friend says there's no way someone could take out ~mission(KillCount) Navy starmen in ~mission(KillTime). I say that all you need is the right person for the job. Plus, as long as your crimestat stays that high, any security you run into should summon the Navy right to you. Easy pickings.  \n\nWhat do you say? Do it and half the winnings are yours. The timer starts as soon as you shoot the first one.\n\n
murderspree_desc_0003=I'm sure you're aware, but recently the Navy's been trying to clean up Stanton. As someone who's clearly no fan of the law, that's pretty bad for you, and even worse for me. I work for one of the big security firms in the system (not saying which) and all our jobs have dried up since the Navy started taking on a larger role.\n\nWhat I need is a disaster that can prove to the suits with the credits that the Navy aren't the saviors they think they are. \n\nYou're going to be my disaster.\n\nI'll pay you some serious credits to take out ~mission(KillCount) Navy starmen in under ~mission(KillTime). And with your crimestat at level 5, the heroic Navy will show up any time you run into security making it that much simpler. I’ll start the time once the first shot lands. Figure a spree of this magnitude should be enough to scare just about anyone into hiring my firm.

northrock_boarders_890J_desc_001=An executive client just informed us that their 890 Jump had been intercepted at ~mission(Location) and boarded by outlaws.

The longer the outlaws have control of the vessel, the higher the chance it will be lost. I recommend you acquire a team for this outing to expedite matters. \n\nNote that thanks to a small contingent of Security Personnel who stayed aboard, all surviving members of the crew were able to flee in an escape craft. The current status of the remaining security is unknown, but just in case, keep an eye out for friendlies when you engage the hostiles.\n\nSecondly, if at all possible, the client is *very* interested in preventing the theft of the aforementioned data.

I'm a logistics officer for the Stanton branch of Northrock Service Group, one of the top rated private security firms in the system, and we are looking to expand our portfolio of qualified contractors.\n\nNow, even though you are certified by the Bounty Hunters Guild, Northrock will need you to complete a pro tem contract to make sure you're a good match. I'm thinking I'll start you off collecting the bounty on ~mission(TargetName). They were last seen at ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nGet that done and we'll see about getting you more work.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_desc_rehire=So, enough time has passed that I got management to agree to giving you a second chance at being a bounty hunter for Northrock. If you are able to prove yourself capable of successfully completing a contract that is.\n\nApprehend ~mission(TargetName) and we can see about getting you reinstated. They were last seen at ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_fps_UGF_boss_desc_001=Hey, \n\nHave an interesting bounty for you. A high level criminal by the name ~mission(TargetName) has been located at ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nBased on our intel, its highly unlikely that the target’s going to be sitting and waiting out in the open. You most likely will have to infiltrate the facility and draw them out. \n\nSomething like a large firefight should be enough to do the trick. \n\nBest of luck,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group\n
northrock_bounty_fps_UGF_boss_nocivs_desc_001=Hey, \n\nGot a contract for you that requires a bit more tactics than usual. A high-level criminal by the name ~mission(TargetName) is hiding with a large contingent of outlaws at ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nOur intel suggests that ~mission(TargetName|Last)’s forces most likely will act as defensive line in order to protect their boss. My best guess is that you will have to deal with them before you gain access to ~mission(TargetName|Last).\n\nThat said, I don’t want you shooting indiscriminately. Sometimes these outlaws keep civilians around and they should be treated like non-combatants.\n\nBest of luck,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group\n
northrock_bounty_fps_title_001=Bounty Assignment: ~mission(TargetName) (?RT)
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_001=Convicted criminal ~mission(TargetName) has escaped from a local rehab facility and Northrock's been contracted to return the inmate to custody. In my experience, escaped prisoners tend not to give up peacefully, so use any method you can to find and subdue the escapee. \n\nMight be worth staking out spots where they could attempt to hack their record clean. Wouldn't be the first time a prisoner has tried to wipe their sentence after escaping.\n\nGood hunting,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_002=Northrock received a bounty on a prison escapee that goes by the name ~mission(TargetName). They'll probably try to lay low for awhile, but the best way for them to do that is to hack their record clean. I'd start by checking out local spots where they might be able to gain access to the network.\n\nAnd word of warning - expect a fight. People fresh our of jail tend to have extra motivation for not going back.\n\nGood hunting,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_003=Hey,\n\nGot a bit of a livewire for you. Convicted criminal ~mission(TargetName) managed to escape from lockup and are on the run.\n\nNo clear sign where they might be headed, but I'd say check any spots in the area where they might be able to hack their record clear. The smarter crooks tend to start there. \n\nBet they are not going to be happy about running into you.\n\nGood hunting,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_intro=Hey There,\n\nMy name is Braden Corchado and I'm a logistics officer for Northrock Service Group, the leading independently-owned security firm operating in the Stanton system. I may have reached out already, but we try to make it a point of approaching anyone who meets our high standards and encouraging them to complete a pro tem contract. \n\nYou can't do much better than become a Northrock contractor. We have a solid reputation for offering challenging and interesting work at a higher rate of pay then many of our competitors in system. \n\nNow, to get approved, you will need to apprehend one ~mission(TargetName). They have recently escaped from the detention center and your job will be to track them down before they can disappear completely off the grid. \n\nA little hint is that it's safe to assume that the target is going to go try to clear their record. I recommend triangulating your search between the detention center they escaped from and locations where they can hack into the record system.\n\nGet this done and we'll see about getting you more work.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group 
northrock_bounty_prisoner_desc_rehire=Hey,\n\nI know it's been a little while, but if you are still interested in doing contract work for Northrock, I convinced the management to give you a reevaluation. If you can successfully complete a bounty for us, we can see about getting your employment status reinstated.\n\nThis pro tem contract is to track down escaped criminal ~mission(TargetName). Try your best to get to them before they can wipe their record at database access point or the job's going to be significantly more difficult.\n\nHoping we can trust you on this.\n \nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group

They're looking for the capture of several individuals wanted in connection with a major heist, aka ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3).\n\nTake care of the lot in the time allotted, and we're looking a fairly sizable payday. \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_02=Advocacy have been hunting down a group, but haven't had much luck. Lucky for them, NorthRock is ready to pick up the slack.\n\nWe got a time restricted warrant for:\n- ~mission(Target1)\n- ~mission(Target2)\n- ~mission(Target3)\n\nBe careful when you engage the targets. I don't want any of them slipping the net and costing us credits. \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_03=I feel like you've proven yourself capable, so I think you should be able to handle this time restricted group warrant. \n\nWe're sending you out to neutralize ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3). They're most likely not flying together anymore, but at one point they were operating as a pretty cutthroat gang. Racked up quite the hefty felony list before they disbanded.\n\nIt'll be more dangerous trying to capture them all in time, but the payout should be worth it.\n\nFly smart,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_04=Authorities are pretty eager to capture a trio of outlaws in connection with recent crime spree: ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3). \n\nThey're in the wind at the moment, but I trust that you'll be able to track each and every one of them down.\n\nThe payout for apprehending all three should make up for the extra effort needed to capture them in time.\n\nGood luck,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_05=Northrock got handed a bounty for three criminal associates on the run: ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3). \n\nIf they're smart, chances are they split up, so be ready to hunt them down individually.\n\nGood news is that the pay should make dealing with tight time restriction and extra travel worth it.\n\nFly safe,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_groupbounty_desc_intro=Hey,\n\nHope everything is going all right. I may have reached out already, but I wanted to be sure and introduce myself. I'm a logistics officer for Northrock Service Group, the leading independently-owned security firm operating in the Stanton system today, providing a variety of services to all major governmental bodies as well as various private concerns. The reason I am contacting you is because we believe someone with your skills could be a boon to our clients. \n\nNot only that, but I think we'd be good fit for you. Our contractors traditionally get a higher rate of pay than a lot of our competitors in system, and a lot of them tell me how they really enjoy being tasked with the challenging and interesting work we offer. \n\nNow, Northrock holds itself to such high-standards so before we can make anything official, you'll need to achieve approved contractor status by completing a pro tem contract. \n\nI was hoping you could capture several wanted members of an outlaw gang: ~mission(Target1), ~mission(Target2), and ~mission(Target3).\n\nGet that done and we'll see about getting you more work.\n\nHope to hear from you soon, \n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group 
northrock_groupbounty_desc_rehire=Hey,\n\nI've been thinking over everything that went down and decided to speak to management. They've agreed to give you another chance but only if you successfully complete a contract for us.\n\nWe can look at reinstating your employment status if you can bring in this criminal trio:\n~mission(Target1)\n~mission(Target2)\n~mission(Target3)\n\nThey evaded the last Associate who went after them, so you bringing them all in would definitely earn you some points.\n\nHopefully you've gotten your act together since your last job.\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group

Thankfully, they still seem to have the stolen ~mission(Contractor|RecoverSpaceItem) in their possession. \n\nNeed you to track this bastard down, recover the property, and return it to our client at ~mission(Destination). \n\nGood hunting,\n\nBraden Corchado\nLogistics Officer - Stanton Branch\nNorthrock Service Group
northrock_recoverspace_desc_0002=Just got a bit of good news. One of our sources got a tip on some stolen property we've been looking for.

northrock_recoverspace_desc_0003=So it seems that some missing ~mission(Contractor|RecoverSpaceItem) just turned up. Guess where? \n\nIn the back of a thief named ~mission(TargetName)'s ship. Don't know if they actually pulled the job or just ended up holding the stuff, but it's going to cost them big time.\n\nYou're going to go hunt ~mission(TargetName|Last) and convince them to give you the stolen property back.

outlawsweep_desc_0002=Outlaws identified as members of the ~mission(Client) have been seen infilitrating a ~mission(Location).

outlawsweep_desc_0003=Armed members of a local criminal outfit, the ~mission(Client), were seen at ~mission(Location). We can only assume their intentions are hostile so a small team is being assembled to go and clear them out. ~mission(CombatPay) \n\nNow, since we don't want them to give us the slip, figured it would be wise to contact all operators in the area, regardless of skill or track record.

outlawsweep_desc_0004=Moments ago, we received a tip that several members of the ~mission(Client) outlaw organization were reported at ~mission(Location).
