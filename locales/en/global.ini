PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Showdown_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_ThanksForYour=Thanks for your help. Grab your ship and get on site.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpReg_IG_001_HiThisIs=Hi, this is Dulli. Glad to see you stepped up for another emergency. We're still not entirely clear why, but the Nine Tails have taken over the Restricted Airspace around several Crusader platforms and we need you help us regain control. While their inverter device is running, only Nine Tails ships have access, so for now our only way in is via shuttle. Once inside however, there should be several vehicles already in the restricted area that will be operational and should help you disable the inverter. Head to the shuttle as soon as you're ready.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpReg_IG_002_ThisIsSpecial=This is Special Agent Dulli. Thanks for lending us a hand again. So far, all we know is that Nine Tails have taken over several Crusader platforms by using an inverter to control the Restricted Airspace. We haven't heard any demands so we don't know if they're after something in particular or just causing chaos. What we do know is that until the inverter is shut down only Nine Tails ships and any vehicles already on the platforms have access. That means our ships don't work and we'll need to shuttle you in. I'll provide more details as they come, but for now, head over to the shuttle as soon as you're ready.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpReg_IG_003_DulliHereThanks=Dulli here. Thanks for volunteering again. Here's the situation. A large group of armed outlaws known as the Nine Tails have seized control of four Crusader platforms using a Restricted Airspace inverter. This makes it impossible for any non-Nine Tails ships to approach until the inverter is deactivated so that will be your primary job. We've gone ahead and commadeered a shuttle to get you to platform, and once you're inside you should hopefully be able to find a vehicle within the Restricted Area to use. Head to the station once you're ready.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpRook_IG_001_ThisIsSpecial=This is Special Agent Dulli with the CDF. Just wanted to thank you for volunteering. Anyway, we need your help taking back some Crusader platforms from the outlaw gang known as the Nine Tails. They have set up an inverter to seize control of the platform's Restricted Airspace so only their ships can access the area. Since we can't fly in ourselves, we got a shuttle ready to take you to the platforms where we want you to deactivate the inverter. Gather any gear you need and make your way to the station. I'd also recommend creating an imprint at Orison General in case you need to regen. Talk to you soon and thanks again.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpRook_IG_002_HelloThisIs=Hello, this is Dulli with the CDF. Thanks for volunteering. Here's the situation. Nine Tails are currently controlling four platforms and the Restricted Airspace around them, preventing anybody but their own ships from approaching. We need you to get inside to find and deactivate the inverter. We're currently using a nearby shuttle station to send our forces to the closest platform. Gather any gear you need and head there now. You should also create an imprint at Orison General in case you need to regen. Thanks again and talk to you soon.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpRook_IG_003_ThisIsDulli=This is Dulli with the CDF. I appreciate the help. Here's the current sit-rep. A large group of armed Nine Tails operatives have taken control of the Restricted Airspace around several Crusader platforms using an inverter system, making it so only their ships can fly into the area. This means a conventional assault's impossible. Instead we're using a shuttle from a nearby station to get our people on site in order to shut down the inverter. Grab your gear and we'll send you over. Oh, I generally advise all CDF volunteers to set their regen at the local medstation in case things go bad, so I'd recommend hitting up Orison General before you come out. Thanks again.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpVet_IG_001_JustSawYou=Just saw you signed up and wanted to say I'm glad we have some veterans answering the call. We're going to need experienced volunteers like yourself since the Nine Tails have gained control of the Restricted Airspace around several Crusader platforms.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpVet_IG_002_GladToHear=Glad to hear you're going to be joining us for another operation. The Nine Tails have managed to take control of the Restricted Airspace around several Crusader platforms. We're counting on you to shuttle over to the platforms and help us take them back. Make your way there as soon as you're ready.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_Siege_ExpVet_IG_003_ItsDulliJust=It's Dulli. Just wanted to thank you for volunteering. Having tried and tested operators on our side is always beneficial for the new recruits.  Long story short, Nine Tails have seized control of the Restricted Airspace around multiple Crusader platforms. We can't launch a full aerial assault until you fight your way through and help us retake it. Take the shuttle to the platform as soon as you can.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_WithCrimeStat_Siege_IG_001_ThisIsSpecial=This is Special Agent Dulli. I appreciate the effort, but it looks like you've got an active CrimeStat.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Accepted_Mission_WithCrimeStat_Siege_IG_002_ThisIsDulli=This is Dulli with the CDF. Thanks for volunteering, but we can't accept anyone who's got an active CrimeStat. There's a chance that you could be mistaken for an outlaw in the heat of battle. Get it resolved and we can talk.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_AAInactive_Siege_IG_003_YouShouldBe=You should be good to approach that platform, there aren't any active anti-air.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_EnemyCleared_Siege_IG_001_ThisPlatformsSecure=This platform's secure, so do whatever you gotta do here and move onto the ones that aren't secure.

The lieutenant on this platform's been taken out, but the anti-air is still online. You aren't going to find a shuttle to get to the Admin Center, so you'll need to get the anti-air offline and commandeer a vehicle to get there.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_HardIsland_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_002_WantedToGive,P=Wanted to give you a quick update. CDF volunteers have taken out this platform's lieutenant but the anti-air's still active. Since there isn't a direct shuttle between this platform and the Admin Center, you'll need to take out this AA in order to safely commandeer a ship.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_HardIsland_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_003_JustAHeads,P=Just a head's up. The lieutenant on Hartmoore's been taken out, but its anti-air system is still active. You'll need to take that out before you can commandeer a vehicle to get to Admin Center.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_Siege_AreaObjCleared_IG_001_TheLieutenantAnd,P=The lieutenant and anti-air on this platform have both been taken care of. You should be good to move onto the next one.

You'll need to disable that if you want to commandeer a ship to the next island. Otherwise, you'll need to take the shuttle.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_002_ThisPlatformsLieutenant,P=This platform's lieutenant has been taken care of, but you won't be able to safely commandeer any ships unless you disable the anti-air.

Otherwise, there's an active shuttle to the next platform.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_VeryHardIsland_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_001_QuickStatusUpdate,P=Quick status update. The Admin Center's lieutenant has been taken out. There's still anti-air coverage but latest intel suggests the IFFI for this platform is located on the barge, not this island. So you'll need to go there to shut it down. You can still destroy the turrets up close if you want.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_VeryHardIsland_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_002_HeresTheLowdown,P=Here's the lowdown. The lieutenant of this platform's already been neutralized but the anti-air is still operational. We think the IFFI controlling this airspace is located on the barge, so you can either find it there or take out the turrets yourself.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionArea_VeryHardIsland_Siege_DefeatAA_MiniBossDead_IG_003_JustSomeIntel,P=Just some intel as you approach Admin Center. The lieutenant's been taken out but CDF volunteers haven't found an IFFI here. We think that the anti-air is being controlled from the barge, so I'd start searching there unless you want to blow them up yourself.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionObj_Barge_Siege_DefeatBoss_IG_001_WeveGotEyes=We got eyes on the Commander. I want Mendo Ren taken out!

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionObj_HardIsland_Siege_DefeatMiniBoss_IG_001_ShitThatsNolan=Shit? that's Nolan Acker. Guy worked Area18 as a security contractor for BlacJac until they discovered he was moonlighting as an enforcer-for-hire for criminals. Watch yourself with this one.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionObj_HardIsland_Siege_DefeatMiniBoss_IG_002_ThatNineTails=That Nine Tails lieutenant is Nolan Acker. File says he's a former security officer with extensive combat experience, so watch yourself out there.

A career criminal from the looks of it. Has been with the Nine Tails for almost as long as they've been operating. You don't last that long unless you're a survivor. Use caution.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_MissionObj_VeryHardIsland_Siege_DefeatMiniBoss_IG_002_ManagedToPull=Managed to pull an ID on this guy. Name's Art Kelvin. Did time in QuarterDeck and a slew of other prisons around the UEE. Guy's got an arrest record that goes back twenty years.  Watch yourself.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_NFZActive_Siege_IG_001_ThisPlatformHas=This platform has mostly been cleared out, we just need to reverse the Restricted Air to stop them from reinforcing.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_NFZActive_Siege_IG_002_AllOfThe=All the active objectives for this platform have been cleared, you just need to deactivate Nine Tails' control of the Restricted Air to stop them from reinforcing.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_NFZActive_Siege_IG_003_TheLieutenantsBeen=The lieutenant's been handled, so you don't have anything to do on this platform until the Restricted Air is returned to Crusader.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_Siege_MiniBossesAlive_FirstOccur_IG_001_WeveStillGot=We've still got an active Nine Tails lieutenant on this platform. You'll need to find and neutralize them in order to draw out the commander and shut down the inverter.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_Siege_MiniBossesAlive_FirstOccur_IG_002_OperativesHaventBeen=Operatives haven't been able to draw out the Nine Tails lieutenant yet. Once they show up, you'll need to neutralize them.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_Siege_MiniBossesAlive_FirstOccur_IG_003_TheresANine=There's a Nine Tails lieutenant on this platform. If we want to draw out the commander and shut down the inverter, we need to deal with them first.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_Siege_MiniBossesAlive_RepeatOccur_IG_002_TheNineTails=The Nine Tails lieutenant on this platform is still active. Neutralize them so we can draw out the commander.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_Siege_MiniBossesAlive_RepeatOccur_IG_003_WereStillTrying=We're still trying to take down this platform's lieutenant. We need to get them taken care of if we want to shut down the inverter.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_VeryHardIsland_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_001_IActuallyDont=I actually don't know if this platform has a name. Crusader's just referenced it as the Admin Center. There aren't any ships to commandeer here, but if you're able to take it back from the Nine Tails, you should be able to make your way to the cargo barge by foot.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_VeryHardIsland_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_002_ThisIsThe=This is the Admin Center. I'm not entirely sure what it's used for, probably Admin, but Crusader says there aren't any ships here, so you should be able to get to the barge by foot.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_VeryHardIsland_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_003_ThisLastPlatforms=This last platform's the Admin Center. I guess it handles infrastructure or something. Anyway, there won't be any vehicles to commandeer here, but you should have the ability to get to the cargo barge by foot.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_WreckSite_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_FirstOccur_IG_001_AllRightYoure=All right. You're coming up on one of the wrecks. I?d suggest scanning the debris if you haven?t already.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_WreckSite_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_FirstOccur_IG_002_YouShouldBe=You should be nearing one of the ship wrecks. General course of action is to do a quick scan of the debris.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Approach_WreckSite_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_FirstOccur_IG_003_ThereShouldBe=There should be a wreck nearby. You're gonna want to do a scan of the debris to see if there are any supplies remaining. XenoThreat have been known to hide out in the ships too. Last thing you want are any surprises.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Cancelled_Mission_Siege_IG_003_AttentionCrusaderIs,P=Attention. Crusader is reclaiming jurisidiction over this operation. They need all CDF volunteers to vacate the area immediately.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_C2Starlifter_Siege_IG_001_HappyToSee=Happy to see a Starlifter. With the C2, we could potentially strengthen our ground position on the other platforms by transferring ground vehicles between them. Just need to be careful of any active AA.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_C2Starlifter_Siege_IG_002_ThisC2Could=This C2 could make a big difference to the Op. Not only can the starlifter hold its in own, but being able to move ground vehicles could come in real handy. As long as you can avoid any remaining anti-air defenses that is.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_C2Starlifter_Siege_IG_003_NiceAC2=Nice, a C2. The CDF has worked with these on other operations. They're sturdy and the cargo space gives a lot of flexibility. Looking forward to seeing what you can do with it. Just be sure to keep an eye out for any remaining Nine Tails AA when you're flying.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_M2Starlifter_Siege_IG_001_TheStarlifterIs=The Starlifter is an impressive piece of military hardware. More that a few battles have been won with the M2s help. Will be good to have one in the air. Just be careful engaging with any remaining AA defenses.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_M2Starlifter_Siege_IG_001_TheStarlifterIs_edit=The Starlifter is an impressive piece of military hardware. Will be good to have one in the air. Just be careful engaging with any remaining AA defenses.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_M2Starlifter_Siege_IG_002_AHeavyShip=A heavy ship like this M2 should help if you encounter any Anti-Air defenses still under Nine Tails control and provide the right leverage to access any heavily defended platforms.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_M2Starlifter_Siege_IG_002_AHeavyShip_edit=A heavy ship like this should help if you encounter any Anti-Air defenses still under Nine Tails control and provide the right leverage to access any heavily defended platforms.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_M2Starlifter_Siege_IG_003_AllRightAn=All right, an M2. Exactly what we needed. These are some of the toughest ships Crusader makes. Just the sight of one should be enough to get these Nine Tails quaking in their boots. Avoid any AA fire and head to the next area.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_M2Starlifter_Siege_IG_003_AllRightAn_edit=All right, exactly what we needed. These are some of the toughest ships Crusader makes. Just the sight of one should be enough to get these Nine Tails quaking in their boots. Avoid any AA fire and head to the next area.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_PiscesShuttle_Siege_IG_001_NotSureHow=Not sure how the Pisces is going to do here. It's light and nimble, which is good, but with the AA defenses on these platforms still active something with more armor might make sense.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_PiscesShuttle_Siege_IG_002_SeeYouFound=See you found a Pisces. As long as you avoid any direct AA fire, a smaller craft like this could be a good choice for infilitrating the platforms. But if you find an option with more armor that might be the safer choice.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_PiscesShuttle_Siege_IG_003_IWouldHave=I would have gone for something with a bit more armor than a Pisces, but then I'm not the best pilot. In the right hands, a smaller craft could be a smart option for navigating the platforms. Guess we'll see.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_StarRunner_Siege_IG_001_YeahStarRunner=Yeah, Star Runner could be a good choice to move some people to other platforms.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_StarRunner_Siege_IG_002_YouEverFlown=You ever flown one of these before? Manuevering thrusters stick a bit too much for my liking, but we'll take whatever we can get.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_StarRunner_Siege_IG_003_GreatGetThat=Great. Get that Star Runner up and out. We need air support to move other operatives and take on the Nine Tails and their AA.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Comment_PlayerShip_Starfighter_Siege_IG_001_YeahThatsA=Yeah, that's a good choice. You can do some serious damage to AA or Nine Tails ships with that thing.

All of the Nine Tails command have been dealt with and we just need to find their inverter to restore control of the Restricted Airspace back to Crusader. Get down there and get it done. If you need any more details, check your mobi.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_BossDead_RepeatOccur_IG_002_ItsLookingLike=It's looking like we're very close to getting control of the Restricted Airpsace. The Nine Tails commander and lieutenants are all neutralized. Now we just need to find and disable their inverter on the cargo barge to stop their reinforcements and allow our ships access again. Your mobi has been updated with all the details.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_BossDead_RepeatOccur_IG_003_HeresAQuick=Here's a quick brief. The Nine Tails Commander and Lieutenants have been dealt with. We're just searching the barge for that inverter to restore command of the Restricted Airspace to Crusader. Any questions, check your mobiGlas for a full breakdown.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_001_AllRightWelcome=All right, welcome to the operation. Here's the situation. A short while ago, Nine Tails outlaws infiltrated and attacked these commercial platforms. Your primary goal is to return control of the Restricted Airspace to Crusader, that way we can grant our ships access and block Nine Tails from bringing reinforcements to the platforms. \n\nWe know that the Nine Tails are using an Identity Friend or Foe Inverter to control vehicle permissions, so that's your target. We think it's being stored somewhere on the central cargo barge in a locked storage container. Unfortunately, the Nine Tail in charge of this mess has been identified as Mendo Ren, a longtime member tied to dozens of robberies and murders. \n\nBased on his M.O., we know he'll keep a low profile until we eliminate the other Senior Level Nine Tails. So travel to each of the platforms, neutralize the Nine Tail Lieutenant there, then engage Mendo once he comes out of hiding to get his access codes and shut down the inverter. Right now, the platform you're heading towards is Solanki Platform, it's some kind of commercial residencey for visiting VIPs. You might find a few small ships stored there. Crusader's given us permission to commandeer them. You're going to need them to reach the cargo barge when it's time as the platform's shuttle system doesn't directly connect to it. I'll provide updates as you progress. Good luck.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_002_NowThatYoure=Now that you're here, I wanted to get you up to speed on the operation. You're approaching a small network of platforms that Crusader uses for VIP Sales. Nine Tails outlaws have seized control of the air and platforms and we need to take them back. Your first objective will be to return control of the Restricted Airspace back to Crusader. The Nine Tails are using a device called an Identity Friend or Foe Inverter so they can bring in reinforcements while our own ships are locked out. \n\nWe know that the device is being hidden in a locked storage container somewhere on the cargo barge docked at central platform. It seems however that the only person with the container's access codes is Mendo Ren, a veteran Nine Tails outlaw, who is in charge of this attack. Having dealt with him before, we believe that he will stay hidden until he is forced to get involved. This means that to get to Ren, you will first have to neutralize the Nine Tails lieutenants he's assigned to each of the platforms. Once you take them out, you can get the codes from Ren, and shut down the inverter. \n\nThe platform you're headed to now is Solanki Platform. I'm told Crusader uses it to house VIPs that are visiting Orison. There should be a few small ships here that we have permission to use. Comandeering vehicles will be vital to us reaching the central platform as it is disconnected from the shuttle system. I'll make sure to update you if anything changes. With your help, I have faith the CDF is going to come out on top today.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_003_BeforeYouArrive=Before you arrive at the platform, let me give you a high level brief of the situation. Members of the Nine Tails outlaw pack seized control of five platforms outside Orison. Our biggest concern at the moment and your main objective will be regaining control of the Restricted Airspace. The Nine Tails have smuggled an Identity Friend or Foe Inverter into that area which is keeping all our ships out and letting theirs in. \n\nWe need to get the Inverter shut down as soon as possible, but doing so is going to be a bit tricky. The device is being stored in the cargo barge docked at the central platform, and the only one with the codes to access it is the Nine Tails commander, Mendo Ren. Now, from the intel we gathered, Ren will stay out of sight unless necessary. That means we will need to remove the Nine Tails Lieutenants from the platforms to draw him out. Once we take him down, we can get the codes from him and take the inverter offline.  \n\nCurrently you are headed towards Solanki platform, which is used by Crusader to host visiting VIPs. Thankfully, there are several small craft stored there that we'll be able use to move between platforms. We're going to need them to reach the central platform and the cargo barge when the time comes since the shuttle system doesn't connect there, so don't waste the ships. That should be all the info you need for now. I'll check back in soon. The full mission details and current status will be updated in your mobiGlas. Stay focused, watch yourself, and let's get this done.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_MiniBossesDead_FirstOccur_IG_001_AllRightWelcome=All right, welcome to the operation. Your mobi should have the latest updates but here's a quick rundown. Nine Tails outlaws seized control of these commercial platforms and have been causing chaos. Your primary goal is to return control of the Restricted Airspace to Crusader, that way we can grant our ships access and stop Nine Tails reinforcements from reaching the platforms. We know that the Nine Tails are using an Indentity Friend or Foe Inverter or IFFI to control vehicle permissions so that's your target. It's being stored somewhere on the central cargo barge in a locked storage container. Unfortunately, the only one with the access codes is the Nine Tail in charge of this mess, Mendo Ren. \n\nFinding him and getting the codes is your first task. Once you have them we can finally shut down the inverter. Right now, the platform you're heading towards is Solanki Platform, it's some kind of commercial residencey for visiting VIPs. You might find a few small ships stored there that Crusader's given us permission to commandeer. You're going to need them to reach the cargo barge when it's time as the the platform's shuttle system doesn't connect to it, so use them wisely. I'll check in with any updates as you progress. Good luck.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZActive_Siege_MiniBossesDead_FirstOccur_IG_002_NowThatYoure=Now that you're here, I wanted to get you up to speed on the operation. You can always check your mobi for the latest details, but our first objective will be to return control of the Restricted Airspace back to Crusader. Currently the Nine Tails are using an Identity Friend or Foe Inverter to make it so they can bring in reinforcements while our own ships are locked out. We know that the device is being hidden in a locked storage container somewhere on the cargo barge docked at central platform. It seems however that the only person with the container's access codes is Mendo Ren, a veteran Nine Tails outlaw who's in charge of this attack. I want you to focus on finding him and getting those codes so we can shut down the inverter. \n\nThe platform you're headed to now is Solanki Platform. Crusader uses it to house VIPs visiting Orison. There should be a few small ships here that we have permission to use. Comandeering vehicles will be vital to us reaching the central platform as it is disconnected from the shuttle system.

For full details on the mission, everything should be up to date in your mobiGlas. Our biggest concern at the moment is regaining control of the Restricted Airspace. The Nine Tails have smuggled in an Identity Friend or Foe Inverter that's granting their ships access while blocking ours. This is allowing them to bring in their reinforcements to the platforms. We need to get the Inverter shut down as soon as possible, but doing so is going to be a bit tricky. \n\nThe device is being stored in the cargo barge docked at the central platform, but the only one with the codes to access it is the Nine Tails commander, Mendo Ren. I want you focused on tracking down Ren and getting the codes off of him. \n\nCurrently, you are headed towards Solanki platform, which is used by Crusader to host visiting VIPs. Thankfully, there are several small craft that we will be able use to reach the central platform and the cargo barge since the shuttle system doesn't connect there. That should be all the info you need for now. I'll check back in soon. Just stay focused, and let's get this done.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZInactive_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_001_AllRightWelcome=All right, welcome to the operation. Your mobi should have the latest updates but here's a quick rundown. We have managed to return control of the Restricted Airspace to Crusader, but there's still plenty of work to do. All remaining Nine Tails forces and anti-air defenses under their control need to be dealt with before we can fully regain the platforms. \n\nRight now, you're heading towards Solanki Platform, it's some kind of commercial residency for visiting VIPs. If you don't want to use your own vehicle, you might find a few small ships stored there that Crusader's given us permission to commandeer. You could also use the platform's shuttle system to get around if need be. I leave it up to you. I'll check in with any further updates as you progress. Good luck.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Enter_Shuttle_NFZInactive_Siege_FirstOccur_IG_002_NowThatYoure=Now that you're here, I wanted to get you up to speed on the operation, but you can always check your mobi for the latest details.

Crusader uses it when the have VIPs visiting Orison. You're welcome to use your own ship, but if not, there should be a few small ships here that we have permission to use. I'll make sure to update you if anything changes. With your help, I have faith the CDF is going to come out on top today.

You're welcome to use your ship to get around, but if needed, there should be several small craft stored there that you could use as well. That should be all the info you need for now.

Try looking for that if you're having trouble getting out.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_Exit_CargoBayDoor_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_inRelaxed_FirstOccur_IG_002_IfTheWreck=If the wreck has lost power, XenoThreat might have rigged up something to open the cargo door.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_Exit_CargoBayDoor_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_inRelaxed_FirstOccur_IG_003_IveBeenHearing=I've been hearing that XenoThreat's been offloading through the cargo bay. They must have rigged up something to open the door. Might be helpful if you're looking for a way out.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_DefeatAA_FirstOccur_IG_001_AttentionAllCdf=Attention, all CDF volunteers. The Nine Tails are controlling each platform's anti-air defenses from an inverter hidden in one of the party supply crates. If you can get the access code, you can shut down the AA defenses directly.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_DefeatAA_FirstOccur_IG_002_GotSomeUseful=Got some useful news. The Nine Tails are controlling the AA defenses using devices stashed inside the Pressley's Party Supply crates. The Lieutenants on each platform will have the codes to access the containers. Could be easier than having to manually destroy each one.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_DefeatAA_FirstOccur_IG_003_AllRightEveryone=All right, everyone. We figured out how the Nine Tails are controlling the AA. They've stashed inverters inside party supply containers on each platform. Get the access code from the Lieutenant there and you shut them down.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindAltSolution_IG_001_LooksLikeAll=Looks like the shuttle controls are busted. You're going to have to find another way around.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindContainer_FirstOccur_IG_001_AttentionItLooks=Attention, it looks like the Nine Tails might have used those Pressley's Party Supplies containers to bring some additional ammo and medical supplies in case they needed to restock. Looks like you'll have to find an access code to unlock it though.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindContainer_FirstOccur_IG_002_WeveBeenLooking=We've been looking into these containers from Pressley's Party Supplies and it turns out the company shut down years ago. Our current theory is that the Nine Tails used these to smuggle themselves and their supplies on to the platforms. Might be worth seeing if you can find a code to unlock the ones on this platform.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindContainer_FirstOccur_IG_003_GuessWhatTurns=Guess what? Turns out Pressley's Party Supplies doesn't exist anymore. I'm guessing whatever's inside these locked containers has something to do with the Nine Tails attack. If you can find the code to access them, could be useful to take a look inside.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindContainer_RepeatOccur_IG_001_WeNowKnow=We now know that Nine Tails lieutenants have the access codes for the Pressley's Party Supplies containers they smuggled in.

PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindContainer_RepeatOccur_IG_002_IfTheseContainers=If these containers are anything like the ones on the other platform than you're going to have to get the code off the Lieutenant to open them. Might be worthwhile since the Nine Tails packed all sorts of useful things inside of them.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindContainer_RepeatOccur_IG_003_SeemsTheOnly=Seems the only way to open these Pressley's Party Supplies containers that the Nine Tails smuggled here is to get the code off the Lieutenant on this platform. Could be good to see if there's anything useful inside.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindIntel_FirstOccur_IG_001_WithTheLieutenant=With the lieutenant on this platform dealt with, it might be worthwhile to search their body and see if you can find any usable intel.
PU_ADVREP01_F_DEH_Hint_MissionObj_Siege_FindIntel_FirstOccur_IG_002_NowThatThe=Now that the lieutenant on this platform has been neutralized, I'd suggest searching him for any possible intel. He might have something useful on him.

Oh wait, it's third time's the charm, isn't it? Guess we get to look forward to doing this at least once more. But first things first. Come pay me a visit if you're interested.
PU_BANISTER_MG_CommMsg_JobOffer_2ndChance_IG_003_HeyListenIf=Hey, listen, if you think you might be ready to really give it a go this time - like really, really try - then I might be willing to give you another shot. When you're ready, come and see me.

PU_BANISTER_MG_CommMsg_ReturnProperty_FailSecurity_IG_002_WellYouDidnt=Well, you didn't return the property, and now we had to report it stolen. I think that technically makes you a thief, so you might want to take care of that.
PU_BANISTER_MG_CommMsg_ReturnProperty_IG_001_HeyEhYou=Hey, eh, you still have some property of mine. I'm gonna need you to return it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_CommMsg_ReturnProperty_IG_002_LooksLikeYou=Looks like you have still have some property of mine. Be great if you can bring it back.

PU_BANISTER_MG_EncourageDecision_IG_005_SoYouThink=So, you think you'll do it?
PU_BANISTER_MG_EndRelationship_IG_001_IHateTo=I hate to say it, but I don't think this is going to work.
PU_BANISTER_MG_EndRelationship_IG_002_SoAsHard=So as hard as this is, I think it might be for the best if we just called it quits.
PU_BANISTER_MG_EndRelationship_IG_003_LookITried=Look, I tried to make this work, I really did, but sometimes you just have to accept that some things are a lost cause.
PU_BANISTER_MG_Expletives_IG_001_Crap=Crap!
PU_BANISTER_MG_Expletives_IG_001b_Crap=Crap!
PU_BANISTER_MG_Expletives_IG_002_DamnIt=Damn it!

PU_BANISTER_MG_GenericChatter_IG_001_YouKnowWhats=You know what's strange? I had a fly in here the other day. No idea how it got in or where it came from. Maybe it was in one my foodpacks? Drove me nuts till I chased it into an airlock.
PU_BANISTER_MG_GenericChatter_IG_002_IKeepRunning=I keep running into these people who think stellar cartography is dull. Can you believe it? Cartography! I mean, if you think precisely scanning star systems and charting every single astronomical feature is dull, then I don't even know what to say to you.
PU_BANISTER_MG_GenericChatter_IG_003_HeresSomethingYou=Here's something you may find interesting - my surname, Banister, came from the fact that my ancestors like forty or so generations back were master stair craftsmen. All the wealthiest people couldn't get enough of their stairs. My family crest actually looks like one of those 'in case of emergency' signs.
PU_BANISTER_MG_GenericChatter_IG_004_LetMeBounce=Let me bounce something off you. I'm debating going to either Cassel or to Green for my vacation and you know what, nevermind. I just decided. Tangaroa it is.
PU_BANISTER_MG_GenericChatter_IG_005_HeresAQuick=Here's a quick tidbit for you. Never eat toast with the gravity turned off. I have never seen so many crumbs in my life. Huge mistake.

PU_BANISTER_MG_Greeting_Beacon_Bad_IG_002_OhItsYou=Oh, it's you. I guess that's fine. It doesn't pay to be to choosy at times like this.
PU_BANISTER_MG_Greeting_Beacon_Bad_IG_003_HeyImIn=Hey, I'm in a bit of a bind here, so I'm hoping you can help.
PU_BANISTER_MG_Greeting_Beacon_Bad_IG_004_HeyListen=Hey listen. There's something I need you do.

PU_BANISTER_MG_Greeting_GoAway_IG_001_ListenIThought=Listen, I thought I made myself clear, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't come around here anymore. It's just not working out.
PU_BANISTER_MG_Greeting_GoAway_IG_002_IllBeHonest=I'll be honest, I'm not sure what you think you're doing here. I definitely can't trust you to help, and if I'm being upfront with you, I really don't want to chat with someone I can't trust. It'd be better if you just go.
PU_BANISTER_MG_Greeting_GoAway_IG_003_LookImNot=Look, I'm not saying it's going to be this way forever, but right now I think it'd be better for both of us if you stopped coming here. You go do your stuff. I'll do mine. And if anything changes, I'll let you know.

PU_BANISTER_MG_Intro_1stX_IG_001_HiWelcomeTo=Hi! Welcome to the neighborhood. 2nd Class Junior Cartographer Tessa Banister reporting in. I'm the eyes behind all the ICC scan probes in the\narea. What these little guys see, I see. Which, yes, means I can totally see you. Right. Now... <pause> Anyway, there was actually a reason to why I\ncomm'd. I'm sorta not allowed to leave my post, important jump point scanning and all, so I was hoping you might be able to help me with something.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_FailStreak_IG_001_AnotherFailedRescue=Another failed rescue, huh? You haven't crossed a shaman or something, have you? Not that I believe in curses, but in the face of overwhelming evidence it might not hurt to re-evaluate that stance.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_FailStreak_IG_002_WeKeepTrying=We keep trying to help these people in these distress beacons, but what good is it when these outlaws are getting more and more ruthless. Maybe we have to accept that it's a lost cause.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_FailStreak_IG_003_HowManyIs=How many is it that we've lost now? After that last distress beacon, I'm starting to wonder why we even try.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_FailTurnAround_IG_001_ReallyAShame=Really a shame that about that last distress beacon, but you know, you can't win them all. Still sad though.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_FailTurnAround_IG_002_ListenIKnow=Listen, I know we lost that last pilot, but you can't focus on that. You've helped a lot of people out there.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_FailTurnAround_IG_003_OnThatLast=On that last distress beacon, don't blame yourself for what happened. You were just trying to help.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Fail_IG_001_EvenThoughYou=Even though you weren't able to save that ship from before, it was pretty nice of you to try.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Fail_IG_003_ItWasToo=It was too bad about that ship you tried to help. I guess sometimes our best just isn't good enough.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Fail_IG_004_IWasSorry=I was sorry to hear about that last ship. Really sucks. At least you're okay.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Fail_IG_005_WantedToLet=Wanted to let you know that I appreciate you risking your life to help those people, even if it ended the way it did.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Ignored_IG_001_IWasA=I was a little surprised you decided not to help that last pilot. Guess I was silly for thinking you were the kind of person who cared about people in trouble.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Ignored_IG_002_ItWasTooBad=It was too bad you weren't able to make it to that last distress beacon in time. I'm thinking about sending the pilot's family a fruit basket. A nice one though, one that isn't all melon.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Ignored_IG_003_OhYouRemember=Oh, you remember that last distress beacon? The one you didn't check out? Yeah, so I've been trying to find out what happened to them, but it seems we might have been the last people to have been in contact with them. I guess we were their last hope.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_SuccessStreak_IG_001_HowManyShips=How many ships have you rescued at this point? Got to be some kind of record. You're like a one person Advocacy force.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_SuccessStreak_IG_002_ImKindaBlown=I'm kinda blown away by the number of people you've helped out there. It's like you're some kind of insurance fairy, saving hulls before premiums can go up.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_SuccessStreak_IG_003_AtTheRisk=At the risk of giving you a big ego, it's pretty impressive how many ships you've helped rescue. Good job.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_SuccessTurnAround_IG_001_WayToActually=Way to actually rescue someone! I was starting to think they may be better off if you didn't answer the distress beacons. I'm glad to see I was wrong.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_SuccessTurnAround_IG_003_WantedToSay=Wanted to say nicely done on that last rescue. You heard someone needed help, you went and tried to help them, and in a surprise turn of events it actually worked. Hopefully this is the start of a trend.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Success_IG_001_ItWasNice=It was nice of you to help that ship out.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Success_IG_002_HeardYouGot=Heard you got hit by some trouble out there. Glad you scraped through.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Success_IG_003_WithThatShip=With that ship in trouble... I mean, space is dangerous, but it's good to know there's people like you out there too.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Success_IG_004_AppreciateThatYou=Appreciate that you put yourself on the line to help that ship out. I don't know if there's a lot of people who would have done that.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Beacon_Success_IG_005_ISawThat=I saw that you saved that ship. Kind of amazing that you can change someone's whole life like that.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Canceled_IG_001_GuessYouWerent=Guess you weren't able to finish that last job. Bit embarrassing, when you think about it. Saying you're going to do something, then changing your mind.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Canceled_IG_002_ImSuprisedYou=I'm surprised you canceled on that last job. Must be that modern work ethic my nan was always complaining about.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Canceled_IG_003_SawThatYou=Saw that you canceled the last job. That's too bad. I'm guessing you have your reasons but still... oh well.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Generic_Fail_IG_001_OhItWas=Oh It was too bad to hear that last job didn't work out. I feel sort of responsible since I was the one who set you up with it. Oh well, guess these things happen.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Generic_Fail_IG_002_SeemsLikeThings=Seems like things didn't go that smoothly on the last job. Live and learn as nan used to say. She also used to loved eating citrus. Always had an orange or a pomelo on her. I miss her a lot.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Generic_Fail_IG_003_LooksLikeYou=Looks like you didn't have a lot of luck on that last job. You'll get 'em next time.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_FailStreak_IG_001_SoMyBoss=So, my boss has started asking me about where all the probes I've requisitioned keep ending up. I think I'm good for now, but we can't really afford to lose any more.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_FailStreak_IG_002_LostAnotherProbe=Lost another probe, huh? I guess what they say is true. More probes, more problems.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_FailStreak_IG_003_YoureReallyNot=You're really not having any luck with these probes. Like none. It's almost impressive.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Fail_IG_001_NoLuckOn=No luck on that last probe, huh? Eh...I guess we'll just have to make do without for now.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Fail_IG_002_ItsTooBad=It's too bad you're weren't able to deploy that last probe. It would have come in handy.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Fail_IG_003_IDidntThink=I didn't think deploying a probe would be that hard, but I guess it's just one of those things that depends on who's doing it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Fail_IG_004_LooksLikeYou=Looks like you ran into some trouble placing that probe. I will admit, I'm a bit disappointed. I was really hoping to see the data it would've provided.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Fail_IG_005_ShameThatWe=Shame that we couldn't get that last probe deployed. The ICC really counts on those scans.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_SuccessStreak_IG_001_ThoseLastFew=Those last few probes you helped me with, we've been getting some really fanastic data. Who knows, maybe at this rate I'll be a first class junior cartographer soon!
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_SuccessStreak_IG_002_TheMoreOf=The more of those probes you deploy for us, the clearer picture we're getting of the system. It's been a huge help.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_SuccessStreak_IG_003_YoureTurningInto=You're turning into quite the probe expert, aren't you.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Success_IG_001_QuickUpdateFor=Quick update for you, that probe you deployed has been working out great so far.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Success_IG_002_InCaseYoure=In case you're interested, we've been pulling a ton of really useful data from the last probe you set up, so thanks again for your help on that.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Success_IG_003_YouShouldSee=You should see some of the scans coming in from the last probe you deployed. I mean, it would probably just look like a jumble of numbers to you, but take it from me, it's very exciting.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Success_IG_004_WantedToLet=Wanted to let you know that we've gotten some really interesting data from the last probe, so thanks again for deploying it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Probe_Success_IG_005_IveBeenSpending=I've been spending a lot of my shift pouring over scans from that last probe. There's some really intriguing stuff coming through.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Fail_IG_001_DecidedToCome=Decided to come back and see if I was still alive? Well, despite a certain someone, I luckily am.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Fail_IG_002_IveBeenThinking=I've been thinking about how that last attack went down and I have to say, it might be worth spending a few more hours training in a flight sim. You know, so you don't let down the next person who relies on you.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Fail_IG_003_JustThoughtId=Just thought I'd tell you that I forgive you for what happened during the attack. You tried, and that's what matters.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Success_IG_001_IJustWanted=I just wanted to say again how much I appreciate your help with those outlaws. I don't what I would have done if you hadn't shown up when you did.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Success_IG_002_ThanksAgainFor=Thanks again for the help with that attack. I'm still a bit shaken up. I keep jumping at the smallest thing. There was a commercial for popcorn on last night and I nearly had a heart attack.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_UnderAttack_Success_IG_003_IKeepThinking=I keep thinking about the attack, imagining how many different ways it could have gone wrong... Kind of amazing how many things had to go right for both of us to get through that alive.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Unkown_Fail_IG_001_GuessYouWere=Guess you were too busy to check out that unknown reading for me. That's fine. Could have been a huge discovery and we'll never know, but I understand.
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Unkown_Fail_IG_002_YouKnowThat=You know that thing I wanted you to scan for me? The one you didn't do? Well turns out someone else did. Their name's going to be in the Galactapedia now. Bet that feels nice for them, huh?
PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Unkown_Fail_IG_003_DidntEndUp=Didn't end up doing that scan, huh? That's too bad. Would have been interesting to see what was actually out there.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Unkown_Success_IG_002_AppreciateYouLooking=Appreciate you looking into that scan for me. Between me and you I had been hoping we might discover a new lifeform, like a sentient rock or something, but what you found was pretty neat too.

PU_BANISTER_MG_LastMission_Unkown_Success_IG_004_IGottaSay=I gotta say, for just being someone who flew by one day, you've proven pretty useful so far.

PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_Complete_IG_001_OhGreatYou=Oh great! You placed the probe! Let me just try to sync with its signal and... there. Full connection. Oh, just look at all that data.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_Complete_IG_002_IHopeYouDidnt=I hope you didn't run into too much trouble placing that probe. I'll connect to it now and make sure we're good. <beat> Hey, look at that. Synched on the first try. You are a natural at placing things.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_Complete_IG_003_WellSinceThe=Well, since the probe is in position, let me just bring it online. Oh, look at that. Data's just pouring in. Nicely done. Well probed. Which actually might be the first time anyone's used that as a compliment.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_Complete_IG_004_LooksLikeThe=Looks like the probe is in place. All that's left is to sync my systems and we are up and running. Excellent.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_Complete_IG_005_OkayStepOne=Okay. Step one was deploy the probe. You took care of that. All that's left is step two, me remotely connecting to it. Finger's crossed. There we go. Step two complete! Don't we make quite the team.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_EncourageFinish_IG_001_JustOutOf=Just out of curiosity, I did ask you to place a probe for me, right? I'm pretty sure I did, but maybe I just thought about doing it, and.. oh wait, no, have it here in my notes. Probe. Awesome. As soon as you have it in position, let me know.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_EncourageFinish_IG_002_NotThatI=Not that I don't appreciate the visit, but I think you're supposed to be dropping a probe for me. Once you get it in place, come and let me know.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_EncourageFinish_IG_003_AnyLuckWith=Any luck with that probe, yet? It'll be exciting to start scanning as soon as you have it set up.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_EncourageRepos_IG_001_LooksLikeYou=Looks like you placed the probe! Let me just try to sync with my system and... oh, that's not good. The scan is off. I really hate to do this, but I think we might need to redeploy it in a slightly different position. Here, this should do it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_EncourageRepos_IG_002_GreatSinceThe=Great. Since the probe is in place, all that's left is to sync the signal and ... I don't understand. It should be sending - Ohhhh. I think I know what's wrong. It's the positioning. Looks like you're going to have to go back and deploy it somewhere else. Here, let me update the coordinates.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MidMission_Probe_EncourageRepos_IG_003_OkayTheProbes=Okay, the probe is in position, so let me run a quick diagnostic. <pause> Crap. That's not gonna work. Looks like we might have to reposition the probe a bit. You mind going back and adjusting its positioning? I'm really sorry.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_1stXIntro_IG_001_SeeSometimesI=See, sometimes I accidentally pick up distress beacons that are outside of ECN range, but if I went chasing after all of them, I'd totally lose my job, not to mention get blown up by outlaws. But on the other hand, it's not like I can just sit here and do nothing, so I try to pass them along and get help when I can. And that's where you come in. If I give you the coordinates, I was hoping you could maybe see if there's anything you could do?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_Generic_IG_001_ShootingYouThe=Shooting you the location of a distress beacon. It is going off hard. You gotta help them. Code of space and all, right?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_Generic_IG_002_ADistressBeacon=A distress beacon just went off. Here are the coordinates. Go. Save.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_Generic_IG_003_TheresADB=There's a DB blinking like crazy on my screen. Here. I sent you the location. If you take a look its a win-win. They get help and I get to stop hearing the damn thing go beep beep beep every freaking second. Oh, and DB stands for distress beacon by the way. Cause I realized I might be the only who calls them DB. Feel free to start using it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_Generic_IG_004_DropWhateverYour=Drop whatever your doing. Two words. Distress bacon. Beacon. Distress beacon. Sorry. I didn't have breakfast. Forget it. Just go help, okay?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_Generic_IG_005_ImPickingUp=I'm picking up a faint distress beacon on my scanners. I'll send you the coordiates. Might wanna be careful though, I was just reading about an outlaw pack that liked to use them to lure people into ambushes. Not that it should stop you from looking. Just, you know, don't get ambushed.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_Generic_IG_006_PickingUpA=Picking up a distress beacon signal at these coordinates. If you check it out, be careful.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PostMsg_IG_001_ItDoesNot=It does not sound good. Sending you the location of the signal. I think you should go try to help. I mean, you don't have to. You can do what you want, or whatever. But after hearing this - are you really not going to?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PostMsg_IG_002_TheyreUnderAttack=They're under attack. Here are the coordinates. You've gotta hurry!
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PostMsg_IG_003_MaybeYouCan=Maybe you can go help? Sending location now.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PostMsg_IG_004_YeahNightmaresFor=Yeah, nightmares for a week. Please, these are the cords, if you think you can help them out, it would be pretty nice of you.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PostMsg_IG_005_ImSendingYou=I'm sending you their location, though to be honest, by the time you get there, not sure how much good you'll be... And I just won the pessismist of the year award. Sorry. Good luck, okay?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PostMsg_IG_006_ItsComingFrom=It's coming from these coordinates. You should help if you can.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_001_ListenToThis=Listen to this.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_002_IJustGot=(frantic) I just got a comm. Here -
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_003_QuickQuestionFor=Quick question for you. This sounds serious, right?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_004_ReadyForYour=Ready for your unsettling comm of the day? And, yeah. Nightmares for a week.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Beacon_PreMsg_IG_005_JustWhenYou=Just when you start to forget that space can be pretty terrible you hear something like this-

PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Generic_IG_003_IDontKnow=I don't know if you're busy or just out coasting, but check this out.

PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Generic_IG_005_IfYoureOn=If you're on the hunt for some credits, and I mean, who doesn't need credits, there's a local posting that could be perfect for you. Here.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_NoAvailable_IG_001_ImSorryTo=I'm sorry to say, but I don't really have anything exciting to tell you at the moment. Pretty boring here, actually. Well, other than the varied and exciting opportunties afforded me as an employee of the ICC, of course.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_NoAvailable_IG_002_GuessWhatTheres=Guess what? There's absolutely nothing going on at the moment. To be honest, if you hadn't shown up when you did, I'd probably be taking a desk nap right now.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_NoAvailable_IG_003_IDontReally=I don't really have anything to give you right now. Unless of course, you're in the mood to do some laundry. Just kidding, I don't actually want you to do my laundry.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_1stXIntro_IG_001_IfYoureInterested=If you're interested, I could use a hand deploying one of our smaller scan probes. They're what we use to survey the areas that the large probes have a hard time seeing. All you'd have to do is pick one up from the depot, deploy it at the specified coordinates, and then come back here so I can do the final sync and verify everything's working. Best part is, I have a budget to hire contractors with, so you'd actually get paid. Take a look and see what you think.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Generic_IG_001_IHaveA=I have a new location that we need a probe deployed to. Think you can help?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Generic_IG_002_JustGotThe=Just got the coordinates for a new probe deployment site. Any interest?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Generic_IG_003_IfYouHappen=If you happen to be in the mood to deploy some scan probes, today is your lucky day. Take a look.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Generic_IG_004_SomeNewAnalysis=Some new analysis came in and it seems we need some more detailed scans for a particular sector. I was hoping you could deploy the probe for me. What do you say?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Generic_IG_005_WereTryingTo=We're trying to get a more detailed picture of a sector, which means additional scan probes need to be deployed, which means potential work for you. What do you think?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostRecover_IG_001_WeLostContact=We lost contact with one of the probes before it could transfer all of its scan data. I need someone to go recover it and take it to the depot, so we can salvage what we can. Here, I'm sending you the specifics.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostRecover_IG_002_TheresAScan=There's a scan probe on the fritz. I was hoping you could grab it and take it to the depot for me. What do you think?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostRecover_IG_003_SoItSeems=So it seems that a scan probe - one of my favorites by the way - is having a few problems. Signal's going in an out. Weird anomalous readings. The works. But I'm hoping that we can still salvage the little guy. You up for grabbing it and taking it to the depot for me?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostReplace_IG_001_OneOfOur=One of our probes went down and needs to be replaced. Straightforward enough except that whatever took out the probe in the first place might still be there. Maybe outlaws? Maybe a storm? I don't know. Here, take a look.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostReplace_IG_002_GotAReport=Got a report this morning that one of the probes went offline. Not sure what happened. One minute it was humming away nicely. Next minute, nothing. Would be lovely if you could deploy a replacement. Just might want to be extra careful when you out there. Interested?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_LostReplace_IG_003_ANewBlind=A new blindspot just appeared in the grid. Seems that a probe went down. It's actually a little suspicous if you ask me. Probes don't usually just switch off like that on their own. Either way, the end result is the same. We have to replace it ASAP. You up for a run?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Repos_IG_001_IveBeenGetting=I've been getting a bit of interference on one of the scan probes and I was hoping that you might be able to move into a better position for me. Here are the details.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Repos_IG_002_AllTheData=All the data I'm getting back from one of the scan probes isn't making much sense. I think it might need to be repositioned. Here, have a look.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Probe_Repos_IG_003_IveBeenScratching=I've been scratching my head over this distorted data set that we've been getting from one of the scan probes. I've tried everything on this end, but at this point, I think the only way to sort it is to physicaly reposition the probe itself. Which, as you may be guessing, is why I'm mentioning it to you. Feel like doing a bit of reorganizing for me?
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_001_NotToSound=Not to sound mysterious or anything, but I'm picking up some really weird pings on my scanners. I don't know if you'd want to check it out and tell me what the hell it is. I would myself, but, you know, I can't leave. <pause> Sorry, forgot the coordinates.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_002_SomethingKindaOdd=Something kinda odd just popped up on my screen and it might be worth checking out. I mean, you don't have to. Might be something cool though... or it could be a chunk of aluminium. I don't know. But I guess that's the point right? Neither of us will know unless you go and see.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_003_SoImGetting=So I'm getting a strange signal on my scan. It's saying it can't ID it. That's odd, right? ID'ing stuff is kind of what scans do. Anyway, not mine apparently, cause I have no clue what they found. Giving you the cords if you're interested in scoping it out.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_004_OneOfMy=One of my probes... God, that's a weird lead-off... I just picked up an odd reading. Might be worth checking out.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_005_IfYouHave=If you have a second. Could you check out these coordiates? Scans are saying something's there, but can't ID it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_MissionBriefs_Unknown_IG_006_MySystemsStuck=My system's stuck processing an unknown reading. I'd love to be able to provide more information on my report than just like five question marks in a row. Think you could take a look at what's at this location?
PU_BANISTER_MG_PerformanceWarning_IG_001_ImNotReally=I'm not really sure what's going on with you. I keep thinking you're going to be able to handle stuff, but then I keep finding out that stuff has definitely not been handled and it's beginning to make me wonder if I should maybe not be giving you stuff at all. But who knows, maybe this time's the charm.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PerformanceWarning_IG_002_IReallyAppreciate=I really appreciate that you're trying to help me out, but at a certain point you're starting to become more of a hinderance. If you can't actually start helping, I'm going to stop asking.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PerformanceWarning_IG_003_ThisIsA=This is a bit awkward, but I got to say it, you've been having a really hard time out there and it seems like no matter what I ask for your help with, it's just not happening. I think you can do better, but if you can't then, well... then I might have to just accept that it's not going to work.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerAcceptsMission_IG_001_GreatGladYoure=Great, glad you're the one handling it.
PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerAcceptsMission_IG_002_SoundsGood=Sounds good.

PU_BANISTER_MG_PlayerDeclinesMission_IG_002_ThatsFineI=That's fine. I can hopefully find someone else to handle it.

PU_BANISTER_MG_SendPayment_IG_003_HereYouveEarned=Here. You've earned this.
PU_BANISTER_MG_SendPayment_IG_004_IllJustGo=I'll just go ahead and send over your payment.

PU_BANISTER_MG_UnderAttack_Thanks_IG_002_ThatWasClose=That was close. I don't know what I would have done if you hadn't shown up when you did. Still can't believe we were attacked.

PU_BANISTER_MG_UnderAttack_Thanks_IG_003_WellThatEnded=Well, that ended a lot better than I thought it was going to. I can't help but wonder why they attacked in the first place. I thought everyone loved the ICC? I mean, who can hate a cartographer?

PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_MistakenTech_IG_001_AhHeyYou,P=Ah hey, you must be the tech from Aciedo. The area's clear so you're good to go down and reset the Array.

PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_RebootRequest_IG_001_PhewThatsThe,P=Phew, that's the last of 'em. It's too bad the damn technicians won't be here for a few days. The whole department's backed up since those outlaw bastards started shutting down Arrays. I'll tell you what, if you're up for it, you could EVA to the Array and restart it. I'd do it myself but you know, corporate politics. Anyway, it's up to you.
PU_CRUPILOT2_CV_RebootRequest_IG_002_ScansClearBut,P=Scan's clear but we're not going to be able to wait around much longer. If you wanted to you could go land and bring the Array back online. Not that I'm asking you to do that but it'd be a pretty nice thing to do if you get me.

If we can eliminate them, then the station will be safe again. They're not going to go easy though. Expect a full out brawl when you arrive.

Not going to be easy facing down this Nine Tails fleet, but we take these ships out and we take the quantum dampener out with them. Then this damn blockade will finally be over.

PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousAbandon_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_LookHereI=Look here. I know that last time the Nine Tails blockaded a station and you volunteered to assist Crusader Security things didn't exactly work out. I'm willing to give you another chance though.

PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousAbandon_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_AllRightPilot=All right, pilot. Let's not beat around the bush - last time you offered to help with a Nine Tails blockade you were less than reliable. But these bastards are at it again, and I need every ship I can get.

PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousAbandon_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. I'm surprised to see you're volunteering again. Last time there was a Nine Tails blockade you left us high and dry. But if there's one thing I've learned is that if someone asks for a chance to prove themselves, you might as well let them try. If you're serious about helping this time, we need to secure the first scan point so we can try and locate the main fleet. We'll see if you can do better this time around.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousFail_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_CommanderHerdsmanHere=Commander Herdsman here. Thanks for volunteering.

PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousFail_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. Thanks for offering to help end this blockade. I know the Nine Tails got the better of us last time, but that was then and this is now.  If we focus and give a hundred and ten percent, I have every confidence that we can stop them. First though, we have to secure the initial scan point so we can locate their fleet. Head over there now.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousFail_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_ISeeThat=I see that you'll be joining us to put an end to the lastest Nine Tails' blockade attempt. Here's hoping things go better for us this time. I sent you the coordinates for our first scan point. Make your way to the site. We will need to secure it to begin searching for their fleet.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceedWell_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_IWasDamn=I was damn glad to see your name pop up.

With you on board, I'm sure we'll be just as successful shutting down the Nine Tails blockade this time around. Head to the first scan area and we'll start hunting for their fleet's location.

Hopefully we can destroy their fleet as successfully as we did last time. Sending you the location of the first point we will need to scan. Head to the coordinates and secure the site.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceed_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. Very happy to see that you're voluteering again. Nine Tails seem to think they'll have a better chance this time around, but with pilots like you rejoining the fight they're sorely mistaken. First things first, we got to secure the initial scan point before we can locate their fleet. I'll see you there.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceed_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_CommanderHerdsmanHere=Commander Herdsman, here. Glad to have you back on board. With how we successfully dealt with the Nine Tails last time around, I have every bit of faith that this current blockade will be shut down with the same efficiency. Let's not waste any time, head to the first scan point and we'll begin our search for the Nine Tails fleet.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_PreviousSucceed_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. I hoped the Nine Tails would've learned their lesson after we took care of their last blockade. Guess I shouldn't be surprised they're at it again. But just like last time, we'll shut them down again. Head to the first scan point and we'll begin searching for their main fleet.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_FirstOccur_IG_001_GladYoullBe=Glad you'll be joining us. We need all the help we can get. I'm Commander Herdsman with Crusader Security and I'll be overseeing this op. The plan is to use scan ships to help us locate whatever the Nine Tails are using to block quantum travel, but we can't do that until we clear a safe zone for the scanners to operate. You have the coordinates of the first scan site. Make your way there now.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_001_CommanderHerdsmanHere=Commander Herdsman here. Good to have you with us. Crusader Security needs to trace the current location of the main Nine Tails fleet, but can't get our scan ships into position until active hostiles have been cleared. Head to the coordinates now.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_002_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman. Nice to see you will be joining Crusader Security for this operation.

Report to the provided coordinates.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_003_ThisIsCommander=This is Commander Herdsman of Crusader Security.

PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_004_CommanderHerdsmanHere=Commander Herdsman here. I'm happy to see you're joining Crusader Security's efforts to end this blockade. First step will be to ascertain the Nine Tails fleet's location using scan ships. But it will be too risky to deploy them until we can fully secure the scan site. Head there now to assist with clearing any hostiles.
PU_CSCDR01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_FleetFind_aPlayer_tAlly_FromAlly_IG_005_CommanderHerdsmanHere=Commander Herdsman here. You've got the coordinates of the scan site I need you to clear. Once we are sure there are no active hostiles we can begin scanning, find the Nine Tails fleet, and hopefully put a stop to this blockade once and for all. Report to the site as soon as possible.

PU_CSCHIEF01_F_DEH_Failed_Event_aNeutral_tSector_FromNeutral_IG_004_AttentionTheRecent=Attention. The recent illegal blockade of a station in Crusader space has been concluded.

I'm sure you did what you could, but this is what happens when we're forced to rely on civilians. Now that traffic can resume to the station, I want a full report on my desk before end of shift.

PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereLiaison=Hey there. Liaison Officer Vanzant with Crusader Security. I'm the one managing your contract with us to - says here, "Destroy Illegal Contraband." Ah, right. Basically, criminals have been setting up these automated production facilities that can just keep turning out product like its nothing. We got coordinates on one of these sites, and we want you to go destroy all the contraband they make. We even got a nice little bonus scheme set up where we'll pay you based on how much product you manage to take off the market. You'll be doing good for the community, and getting a good salary to do it. Nothing wrong with that, right?
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HiImYour=Hi, I'm your Crusader Security Liaison Officer for this contract. That means I'll be supervising while you deal with this automated facility. You should have the details, but the idea is that you'll infiltrate the compound and destroy the packages as they come off the production line, preventing them from getting out into the wild. While the manufacturing process takes care of itself, I wouldn't be surprised if you run into some outlaw resistance anyway. Go in prepared, and you should come out alright. Good luck.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyLiaisonOfficer=Hey, Liaison Officer Vanzant here. Thanks for agreeing to help us deal with this illegal production facility. Crusader Security is very eager to make sure that whatever products are coming off the line don't make it onto market. Once you're on site, deal with whatever resistance there is, and destroy as much of the contraband as you can. Ideally all of it. I sent you the details so you should be all set to go. Safe flying.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HiThisIs=Hi, this is Liaison Officer Vanzant with Crusader Security. I'll be overseeing your contract with us. Appreciate your help in dealing with this illegal production facility. As outlined, the hope is that you'll be able to secure the site and confiscate any contraband you find for delivery to our evidence hold. Now, these so-called criminal geniuses have managed to automate a lot of the production, so its unclear how long they'll be manufacturing product for or how many outlaws will be on site, but I'd go in ready to face some serious resistance. Could get pretty nasty... Sure you'll be fine though. I'll check in on you later.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_GreetingsImA=Greetings. I'm a Liaison Officer with Crusader Security and I'll be supervising your work in helping us deal with this illegal production facility today. It's one of the newer automated style where it's pretty much hands free for the outlaws. Crazy how advanced these things are getting. We'd like you to go there and secure as many of the crates of contraband as you can and bring them to us for processing and disposal. And of course, if there any hostile forces present, you're expected to deal with them as appropriate. And remember, caution is the keyword all around.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyThereCrusader=Hey there. Crusader Security Officer Vanzant comming you about the contract work. Just wanted to make sure everything was clear. You're going to be headed to an automated production facility and grabbing all the contraband that comes off the line. Once you have it secured, you're to bring them to the appointed location so we can properly analyze and dispose of it. Not sure what exactly you can expect in terms of hostile resistance, but it usually pays to be ready for a fight. And just to say it, I'm really happy we hired you for this. Will be great to get all this contraband off the market before it does any damage.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_ExpVet_IG_001_HiThereLiaison=Hi there. Liaison Officer Vanzant. Happy to see you'll be helping Crusader Security out with this contract.

PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_HeyCommingYou=Hey, comming you on behalf of Crusader Security. I'll be supervising your current contract with us. All the details have been forwarded so hopefully that covers everything you need to get started. I'll check in with you periodically, but until then, good luck and be safe.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Accepted_Mission_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_HeyThereThis=Hey there, this is Crusader Security Liaison Officer Vanzant comming about the contract. I'll be your point of contact on this job but it should hopefully be straightforward. You have all details so feel free to get going right away. Just make sure to stock up on any supplies you'll need. Nothing worse than being caught unprepared. Good luck.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Announce_Dropoff_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyItsOfficer=Hey, it's Officer Vanzant again. Just wanted to pass along that the Crusader Security personnel on patrol in your sector have been notified that you're delivering some contraband to our evidence hold for us. You shouldn't run into any problem as you make your way there. At least from us. There's probably a few outlaws out there who'd like to get their product back. Actually, might be a good idea for you make the delivery as fast as you can. Won't be safe flying around too long with this stuff.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Announce_Dropoff_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyThereOfficer=Hey there. Officer Vanzant. Wanted to let you know that I notified the local patrols that you'd be heading through the sector. Didn't want them to be surprised when a ship carting a bunch of contraband turned up. Also told them to keep an eye out for anybody who might be trying to get their hands on that stash you're hauling. Hopefully you won't have any trouble on your way to the drop off.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Announce_Dropoff_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HiLiaisonOfficer=Hi, Liaison Officer Vanzant here. Didn't want you to run into any trouble on your way to the evidence hold, so I've gone ahead and alerted Crusader Security patrols in the area that you're authorized to be traveling with contraband aboard. Should make things easier for you. Now all you have to do is avoid any outlaws trying to take their drugs back and you'll be fine.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_SoJustGot=So, just got a tip hot off the wire. Seems these perps didn?t like us interfering and the site's been ordered offline. Since, they won't be producing any more contraband, destroy whatever's left before heading off.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_WantedToPass=Wanted to pass along an update. The production line's going to be shutting down. Guess these bastards decided to count their losses or lick their wounds or whatever. Go ahead and finish destroying whatever contraband is still on site and then we should be all set.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugDestroy_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyGotA=Hey, got a report from an informant that the production line's going dark. They probably figured there's no point in making more if we're just going to destroy all of it. Speaking of, finishing destroying whatever you can find left down there and then you're good to clear out.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyOneOf=Hey, one of our contacts just let us know that the people operating the site got word of our operation and ordered it to go dark. Collect whatever you can, and bring it to the evidence hold. It's not worth you hanging around there longer than you have to.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyIfThis=Hey, if this report I got is right, that production line should be shutting down any moment now. Finish collecting whatever contraband you can get your hands on and go ahead and bring it to the drop off.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Expired_Mission_DrugSeize_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_SoLooksLike=So, looks like they're going to be deactivating the production line at the sight. Guess the criminals finally got word of what we were up to. Since their won't be any more contraband coming off the line, finish collecting whatever there is and bring it to the evidence hold. Thanks.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BadPerformance_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_OfficerVanzantHere=Officer Vanzant here. I was rooting for you, but with your performance I have no choice but to unfortunately terminate your contract. Sorry, it didn't work out.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BadPerformance_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_LookImGonna=Look, I'm gonna give it to you straight. You just weren't up to snuff this time around. Nothing you can't overcome with a bit of a hard work and practice, but for now I'm going to have to terminate the contract. Hopefully things turn around for you soon.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BadPerformance_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeySoFrom=Hey. So from what I'm seeing your performance isn't up to Crusader Security standards. Gonna go ahead and cancel your contract. Guess you just weren't the right person for this job, huh?
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BadPerformance_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_ThisIsOfficer=This is Officer Vanzant again. It's not good. Your performance has been sub-par and I'm canceling the contract. Nothing personal. Have a good one, okay.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BadPerformance_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_AllRightTheres=All right, there's no easy way to say this, but I'm terminating your contract. Your performance just wasn't meeting our requirements for this job. That's it. Good luck out there.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BreaksContract_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_GeezWhatAre=Geez, what are you thinking? That just because you're working for us you can break the law? That's not how it works, buddy. Contract's canceled, and you can forget about working with Crusader Security until you get your life sorted.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BreaksContract_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_AmIReading=Am I reading this right? Did you actually get a crimestat while working as a security contractor? Talk about not knowing which way your feet are facing. It goes without saying, but we can't have an active criminal on the payroll, so you're fired. Good luck with your legal problems.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BreaksContract_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeyNotSure=Hey, not sure what the hell happened, but an active crimestat means you can't work for Crusader Security. I gotta cut you loose. Contract's over.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_BreaksContract_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_LookIfWe=Look, if we knew you were going to be out there breaking the law, Crusader Security never would have hired you in the first place. That crimestat means you're terminated. That's just how it is.

I know things can get tricky out there but I expected you to be more careful than this. Whatever happened, I'm gonna have to cut you loose. Crusader Security doesn't employ criminals.

Unbelievable! You are so fired. I can't even comprehend what was going through your mind. You know what, I don't care. I'm done with you.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_IllegalKiosk_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_IDidntWant=I didn't want to believe it at first, but I can't argue with the evidence. I can't believe you'd stab me in the back like this. Do you have any idea what kind of damage that contraband you sold will do to the community? Forget it. There's no point in talking to someone like you.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_NotPlayerFault_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyHateTo=Hey, hate to do this, but it seems that Crusader Security isn't going to need your help on this contract after all. Don't worry though. This won't reflect on you at all. Next contract, we'd be happy to have you back. Safe flying until then.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_NotPlayerFault_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyCommingWith=Hey, comming with a bit of bad news. I have to close out the contract.

It's not your fault in the slightest, just one of those things. Crap luck really. Anyway, hopefully we'll have another job for you soon and we can make it up to you. All right. Have a good one.
PU_CSECRREP01_M_DEH_Fired_Mission_NotPlayerFault_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_HeyReallyHate=Hey, really hate to do this to you, but I'm canceling the contract.

Really liking these status reports I'm seeing on your progress. Crusader Security always appreciates contractors who can stay on task and get a job done. At this rate, the whole contract should be finished before too long. And then the best part, getting paid! Okay, I'll check in again later.

PU_DARNEELY_MG_MissionBriefs_Steal_Retrieve_IG_001_FeelFreeTo=Feel free to say no, but a little bird gave me the location of some unfortunates who have been attacking convoys heading through the system.

These outlaws are scum, so it's not like anyone'll miss 'em and the company is gonna claim the insurance, so it wouldn't technically be stealing if you happened to head on down and take it.
PU_ECKHART_MG_GCIntro_SentBBData_V_WP_004_AgainImNot=Again, I'm not saying anything here, I'm just gonna send along a location on that moon and... do what you want.

PU_ECKHART_MG_Intro_PlayerSits_V_WP_Bad_004_IfImWrong=If I'm wrong, we can leave it at that. Enjoy a drink in my spectacular company for a few minutes then we'll part ways with the understanding that this meeting never happened.

PU_ECKHART_MG_MissionBriefs_Bounty_Good_IG_001_IEverTell=I ever tell you that I started out as a bounty hunter? Yeah, after three tours, I guess I wasn't ready for the dogfighting to end.
