PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Announce_LocationInfo_TobinExpoCenter_IG_002_DueToHeightened=Due to heightened security measures in the Stanton System, microTech Protection Services are asking all guests to be extra vigilant when it comes to safety. If you see anything of concern, please alert a member of staff as soon as possible. Thank you.
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Announce_LocationInfo_TobinExpoCenter_IG_003_AttentionVisitorsTo=Attention visitors to the Intergalactic Aerospace Expo - Please remember to stay hydrated while exploring the exhibits on display. For your convenience, a selection of beverages and tasty snacks are available for purchase in the lobby.
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Announce_LocationInfo_TobinExpoCenter_IG_004_TobinExpoCenter=Tobin Expo Center would like to invite everyone to join in and help keep our halls looking their best, for every guest. Please be sure to keep track of all your belongings and deposit any waste in the appropriate receptacles. Thanks.
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Announce_PilotPortraits_IG_001_ToCommemorateThis=To commemorate this year's theme of "Dare to Fly," the IAE wanted to celebrate those who wear the mantle of 'pilot' each and every day. This unique portrait series features pilots from around the universe, captured through the eye of famed portrait artist, Aruto Divani.
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Warn_Expo_Closing_IG_001_AttentionGuestsThis=Attention guests, this Expo hall is about to close for maintenance. Please make your way to the exit and be sure to visit us again soon.
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Welcome_Entrance_IG_001_WelcomeToThe=Welcome to the 2951 Intergalactic Aerospace Expo, where we're celebrating those who "Dare to Fly."
PU_IAEANN02_F_LPA_Welcome_Entrance_IG_002_ThankYouFor=Thank you for visiting New Babbage's Tobin Expo Center, Stanton's preeminent destination for live events and exhibitions.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_BestInShow_IG_001_SelectedByPopular=Selected by popular vote, the IAE Best in Show line up is a chance for your favorite ships to take center stage at the expo. At least most of the time. At the 2938 Expo, that year's winners were all ships too large to actually fit inside the show hall!
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_PilotsIntro_IG_001_WhileItMay=While it may be commonplace to sail through the stars, we should never lose sight of the wonders of space flight from discovering new jump points, unearthing lost ruins, or setting new speed records. Famed artist, Aruto Divani, created this unique portrait series as a tribute to the diverse array of people who eagerly climb aboard their ships and 'Dare to Fly.'
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_Ship_MISCOdyssey_IG_001_MISCsLatestAddition=MISC's latest addition to their already impressive line of ships perfectly encapsulates the spirit of this year's IAE. Push the boundaries of the known universe with their new multi-crew wayfarer ship, the Odyssey. Get a sneak peek in the holoviewer room. Only at the IAE.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_AEGS_IG_001_FewCompaniesHave=Few companies have had as tumultuous a history as Aegis Dynamics. From its earliest days manufacturing iconic warships of the First Tevarin War through the darkest days of the Messer regime, Aegis ships have found a resurgence in the public eye for their versatility and robust construction.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_AEGS_IG_002_NoShipManufacturer=No ship manufacturer personifies this year's theme better than Aegis Dynamics. Whether you're running cargo in a Retaliator or providing security in a Gladius, Aegis ships are putting in work in every corner of the 'verse. Regardless of the controversies that have plagued them over the centuries, pilots continue to trust their lives and livelihood to their tried and true designs.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ANVL_IG_001_AnvilAerospaceMay=Anvil Aerospace may have made a name for itself along the frontlines with its masterfully built fleet of military craft, but more and more of the company's civilian craft have captured the imagination of the Empire. Look no further than the Anvil Carrack to see a ship that has transitioned easily from its Naval origins to the very edges of space as pilots use the ship to chart new territory.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ANVL_IG_002_AsTheWar=As the war against the Vanduul continues, many pilots find themselves seeking a way to protect their home and loved ones during these uncertain times. Anvil Aerospace has been a strong ally in this endeavor, creating civilian versions of their popular military craft, like the Hornet F7-C, to protect you and the ones you care about.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ARGO_IG_001_ContraryToPopular=Contrary to popular belief, Argo Astronautics name doesn't come from the ancient water craft of Earth mythology, but rather is derived from the initials of the company's founder Alana Redmond and is attributed to her mother.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_BANU_IG_001_ItsNotUncommon=It's not uncommon for Human manufacturers to offer unique features and designs to make their ships stand out from the crowd, but the Banu take a slightly different approach when it comes to crafting their vehicles. Heavily and freely borrowing from each other and even other species, Banu ships are made by combining the best features and best technology that they can get their hands on.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_CNOU_IG_001_OneOfThe=One of the newer ship manufacturers to debut at the IAE, Consolidated Outlands has already made its mark on the Expo when it introduced the first ever mobile construction yard in 2947. The Pioneer opened up exciting opportunities for planetary settlement by allowing settlers to create their own modular structures, and forever changing the idea of what a spacecraft could do.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_CRUS_IG_001_CrusaderIndustriesContinues=Crusader Industries continues to surprise ship enthusiasts around the empire. Initially known for their commercial transports like the Genesis Starliner and the Hercules StarLifter, Crusader has been expanding into the civilian market with the introduction of their Ares Star Fighter and Mercury Star Runner. Needless to say, the future is bright for this titan of astro-engineering.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_CRUS_IG_002_UnlikeManyOf=Unlike many of their competitors, Crusader Industries dedicates as much effort on their employees as they do on their products. Recognized as one of the UEE's best employers in 2943 and 2946, Crusader not only offers competitive pay and benefit programs to all employees, but also houses extensive in-house  training and education programs to foster talent and take their workers to the next level of their career.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_DRAK_IG_001_MentionTheName=Mention the name Drake Interplanetary in a room and you're sure to kick off some debate. To some, they're villains, arming the most dangerous elements in the 'verse with the tools to wreak havoc. But did you know that this criminal connection was only made possible because Drake ships were so common? In the infamous Kesselring Heist of 2903, a Drake caterpillar was used specifically because it was easy to blend in with the masses in flight.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_DRAK_IG_002_NoOneBrings=No one brings the thunder to IAE quite like Drake Interplanetary. Love 'em or hate 'em, their ships have become versatile and affordable options for everyone from security and militia forces to haulers trying to scrape a living out in the black. The Drake Red medic ship was recently recognized for the 'most lives saved' thanks to the ship's usage in medstations and hospitals around the UEE.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ESPR_IG_001_ThoughTheExpo=Though the Expo attracts the latest innovations and technological wonders, Esperia is constantly paving the way forward with their reverence of the past. Preserving important historical craft and xeno-vehicles, Esperia defines spaceflight in entirely new ways by providing unique experiences that would otherwise be unavailable to modern pilots.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_GRIN_IG_001_GreycatIndustrialHolds=Greycat Industrial holds the distinction of having the most ever vehicles at a single IAE when in 2926 a thousand buggy parade was driven through the streets of Severus. The highlight was when all of the buggy's sounded their horns together to play a rendition of the Imperial anthem.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_MISC_IG_001_ItsCommonKnowledge=It's common knowledge that MISC builds some of the hardest working ships around, but to get that tough a lot of thought and careful consideration had to go into even the smallest of details. To find the best panel adhesive, MISC ran over a million thermocycle shock tests at their R&D center. The winner alone was able to survive tens of thousands of cycles without failing. Talk about being built to last.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_MISC_IG_002_RepresentedInAlmost=Represented in almost every industry, MISC continues to create reliable, durable, and versatile ships at a variety of pricepoints. One of their toughest tests is known affectionately as the "Meat Grinder." Though the specifics of the test are a proprietary secret, insiders claim that the test aims to inundate the prototype ship with nearly three dozen adverse conditions, sometimes attacking with three to four at the same time in an effort to prove that their ship can survive the harshest of the harsh conditions.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ORIG_IG_001_LuxuryElegancePerformance=Luxury. Elegance. Performance. These are only a handful of the terms that are regularly associated with Origin Jumpworks ships. Since the 28th century, Origin has consistently pushed the boundaries of speed and sophistication, but did you know that their controversial decision to uproot their headquarters from Earth to Terra in 2913 nearly sank the company?
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_ORIG_IG_002_PerpetuallyExpandingWhats=Perpetually expanding what's possible when it comes to high-end performance vehicles, Origin Jumpworks is a fan favorite at the IAE and this year's lineup is sure to impress. When attempting to design a new addition to their roster, Origin engineers have looked for inspiration from a variety of sources. For example, when initially brainstorming designs that would ultimately become the X1, Engineering Director Alberto Vara looked to musical notes to dictate the potential shape language of the open-canopy racer.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_RSI_IG_001_SomeHistoriansCredit=Some historians credit Roberts Space Industries with the invention of modern spaceflight. For founder Chris Roberts, the prospect of making space travel more accessible was a lifelong dream and when his company unveiled their prototype Quantum Core Engine in 2075, suddenly, space travel didn?t seem that fantastical anymore.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_RSI_IG_002_ItsPrettyAmazing=It's pretty amazing to think that RSI makes one of the smallest ships on the market and one of the biggest. It would take about 50 Auroras laid end to end to equal the length of one mighty Bengal carrier.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecManu_XIAN_IG_001_XianShipsAre=Xi'an ships are becoming a more common sight across the UEE, but it wasn't too long ago that their sale was completely forbidden by the Xi'an Emperor. Now, thanks to growing trade between our two species, Xi'an manufacturers like Gatac and Aopoa are producing vehicles specifically for Humans to pilot. Even more promising, some new ships have been designed for Human and Xi'an crew to serve along side each other.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_AegisRedeemer_IG_001_EstablishingFireSuperiority=Establishing fire superiority can be the key to victory. Aegis designers consulted with both active and former members of the UEE military as well as security forces to find out what was and wasn't currently represented in the latest generation of combat gunships. The result? The Aegis Redeemer. Originally debuted years ago, Aegis made the somewhat controversial decision to delay the release of this battlefield equalizer to redesign the interior.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_AnvilSpartan_IG_001_DespiteTheAerospace=Despite the Aerospace in it's name, Anvil has hardly been limited to the skies. For example, the tough and rugged Atlas vehicle platform was developed to help conquer the unforgiving landscape found on moons and planets alike. Both the Ballista and the Spartan were both built from this design foundation, proving its adaptability.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_ArgoRAFT_IG_001_IfYoureLooking=If you're looking to crack into the cargo hauling market, look no further than Argo's new RAFT. This small multi-crew ship utilizes Argo's experience in the industrial ship market and a versatile design to create an affordable entry-level ship that's ready for the long haul.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_CrusaderAres_IG_001_AlthoughCrusaderIndustries=Although Crusader Industries might be best known for their transports, their recent introduction of the Ares Star Fighter shows that the charity-minded manufacturer is taking a new approach to helping citizens across the Empire, and more specifically those who live on Crusader itself. With recent attacks by well outfitted groups like XenoThreat and the Nine Tails becoming all too common, its easy to see why a powerhouse like the Ares was added to their line-up.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_DrakeBuccaneer_IG_001_IntroducedIn2887=Introduced in 2887, Drake's Buccaneer almost begs its pilots to pick a fight. While it doesn't have the versatility of something like the Hornet, the Bucc's got heart... and enough firepower to make it a serious threat in any engagement. Though it's been associated with multiple crimes throughout the Empire, it's also become a mainstay for local security forces and militias looking to keep the peace.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_Origin400i_IG_001_InitiallyConceptedTo=Initially concepted to be a competitor for RSI's classic Constellation line, Origin's 400i quickly developed  its own singular identity. Utilizing Origin's usual high standards of performance and comfort, the 400i evolved into a ship for explorers who didn't feel the need to 'rough it' while pushing the boundaries of the known.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_SpecShip_RSIConstellation_IG_001_SinceItsIntroduction=Since its introduction in 2712, the RSI Constellation has been reimagined countless times, proving itself as varied and long-lived as Roberts Space Industries itself. It has been a cargo hauler, an explorer, a luxury liner, and more. When asked what's next for the Constellation, RSI Designer Deshondra Lewin said "Whatever it is, we will always strive to balance innovation with the tested features that pilots have come to rely upon."
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_ThemeIntro_IG_001_TheThemeOf=The theme of this year's expo is "Dare to Fly" which celebrates the courage of pilots everywhere who boldly take flight to discover new thrills, to seek adventure, and to push boundaries farther than ever imagined. With the right ship and the right frame of mind, anything is possible.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_WeaponsArmor_IG_001_YouMayBe=You may be wondering why an Expo focused on vehicles and spacecraft would want to highlight personal armor and weapons. While its true that getting there is half the fun, what you do when you arrive is just as important. Having the perfect gear on board will help ensure that a landed pilot will be ready to take off again soon.
PU_IAEATNARR01_M_LPA_Welcome_Tour_IG_001_HelloAndWelcome=Hello and welcome to the 2951 Intergalactic Aerospace Expo. This special audio presentation will be your guide to the ins and outs of the various halls and provide unique insight about the vehicles and manufacturers on display.

PU_JTVOGUIDE01_M_LPA_Announce_Tour_BriefingRoom_IG_001_HelloAndWelcome=Hello and welcome to the UEES War Hammer. This Javelin-Class destroyer was originally built by Aegis Dynamics and has been in active service since 2832. Launching under the command of Captain Omar Singh, the ship initially served as a combat support vessel in the 2nd Fleet, 6th Battle Group. A posting that put it close to the Vanduul front. The War Hammer saw action during the Fall of Caliban in 2884 where it protected retreating civilian and Naval forces when the system ultimately fell, earning a ribbon for Valor in the process. For the next several decades, the War Hammer transitioned between fleets in a variety of support and patrol positions, even participating in the UEE push to reclaim the Nexus system in the 2930's. Most recently, the War Hammer distinguished itself as the primary combat vessel to repel the outlaw group known as XenoThreat from the Stanton system. Since then, the War Hammer has been placed in drydock for repairs, but is heading back to active service once this year's Invictus festivities are concluded.\n\nThe room you're currently seated in is the main briefing room for the entire ship. Based around a holovolume built by microTech, the crew gathers here to discuss everything from battle strategies to repair schedules. The Marine detail assigned to this ship also uses this room to plan out their boarding actions or outline combat strategies.

PU_MTSECRREP01_F_DEH_Fired_Mission_BreaksContract_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_YouveGotTo=You've got to be kidding me. We really needed someone reliable on this gig and you go and break the law.

Definitely one of the more popular spaces on the ship, the mess has a fully automated dispensary since we operate on rotating shifts. We have a standard crew complement of sixty-five to seventy and meals need to be available at all times, so we have a culinary team always on duty, ready to lend support. The famous pilot Aria Reilly was once quoted as saying "If you ever want to take the temperature of a ship's crew, spend twenty minutes in their mess." This is one of the main social areas of the ships where crew members from different departments can catch up in their downtime. We also use the mess for social events like birthdays, holidays, and promotions since it's able to hold so many people. Our skipper, Captain Medcalf, is a big believer in casual gatherings in an effort to entrench kamaraderie, so we're in here pretty often. Now you've probably noticed our games in the corner so I'll just address the question that everyone asks: yes, it's pretty competitive. The XO currently has the score to beat. Anyway, I'd like to invite you to have a look around.

PU_NTGUIDE02_M_NTG_Announce_Tour_Barracks_IG_001_HiFolksWelcome=Hi folks. Welcome to the War Hammer. I'm Leading Starman Detmer and this, as you've probably guessed, is one of the two barracks on the ship. I know, I know, you must be thrilled to see where Navy personnel sleep and let me be the first to tell you, it's every bit as exciting as promised. Javelins are pretty great when it comes to the sleeping arrangements as they have enough bunks for the full crew which is amazing because it avoids situations known as 'hot bunking' where you swap out bunks with somebody on the opposite shift. That, is horrible. This one time on my old ship I had to share with this guy who had just the worst smelling socks. I'm talking 'the military could've weaponized it' kind of bad. And I had to try and fall asleep with that stench every, day. So, after that, these bunks are a dream. Actually, I don't think my CO would like me talking about how bad hot bunking is. Maybe just forget I said anything.\n\nAnyway, each one has special slots for personal effects and is capable of sealing up to give you a little privacy as people are always moving around the barracks. Sleeping schedules shift slightly too and they can activate the full crew at a moment's notice if the ship enters heavy combat, so you're always sleeping with one eye open anyway. I mean, we get shorter sleep schedules if we're patrolling in dangerous space, so you're already grabbing sleep when you can. Sorry, I'm rambling. Otherwise... yeah, I'm not sure what else to tell you. This is where we sleep. Not a whole lot of mystery to it. \n\nI hope this has been enlightening. Have a look around if you want, but please don't touch anything in the bunks. This is an active ship and everything in here is the property of the crew, so be cool.
PU_NTGUIDE02_M_NTG_Close_Tour_Almost_IG_001_LooksLikeWere=Looks like we're wrapping up for the day. You should take off.
PU_NTGUIDE02_M_NTG_Close_Tour_Almost_IG_002_TheyreLockingDown=They're locking down the ship soon. You should head out.

PU_NTGUIDE03_F_NTG_Announce_Tour_Turret_IG_001_AllRightLets=All right, let's settle down. My name's Lt. Commander Aldeman, I run the turret complement aboard the War Hammer. That means I'm in charge of coordinating fire between our various gunners during a combat engagement in order to maximize combat effectiveness. But, when we aren't in combat, I strive to keep my team sharp by running through engagement drills and simulated encounters. Now the Javelin comes standard with fifteen turrets, thirteen of which have embedded operators. There are six turrets like the one you see here that run along the side of the ship. Each of which is equipped with a pair of Size 7 cannons for larger targets and a pair of Size 4 gatlings for smaller targets like fighters and even incoming missiles and torpedoes. We've got four more turrets on the bow of the ship, armed with Size 7 energy cannons and three gunners on the underside with the same. All this firepower is coupled with a heavy payload of ordnance to make the War Hammer a real problem for all sizes of ship, hence why we can be tasked to operate independently on patrols without support from the rest of the battle group.\n\nDuring the XenoThreat incursion, our gunners were responsible for the destruction of over seventy hostile elements and several capital ships as well as protecting the ship from incoming ordnance.\n\nAs a special treat, we've safetied this turret so you can get a taste of what it feels like to be a gunner. All the weapons have been deactivated so don't worry about accidental discharge, but I'll remind you this is an active military vessel, so be respectful all the same. Thank you and have a great Invictus.

PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Chatter_CommSilence_Ninetails_aEnemy_tPlayer_FromEnemy_inCombat_IG_004_NineTailsRuns=Nine Tails runs Crusader, and soon we're gonna be running all of Stanton. Nothing nobody can do about it.

PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Engage_SwitchToHostile_Ninetails_aNeutral_tPlayer_FromNeutral_PlayerPerp_IG_005_FineIfThats=Fine, if that's how you want to do this.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Engage_SwitchToHostile_TimerUp_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_IReallyTried=I really tried to give you an out, but fine. Let's do this.

PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Confirm_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_001_HeyThereGot=Hey there. Got word that I should let you pass on through. But just a head's up, it'd be best if you didn't linger around here. Important Nine Tails business and all.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Confirm_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyHowsIt=Hey, how's it going. If you want to pass through here, you won't hear any objections from me. Just can't have you staying in the area for too long. You know, Nine Tails business.

PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Confirm_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_HeyItsFine=Hey, it's fine with the Nine Tails if you want to pass on through here. Just can't have you hang around okay?

PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Deny_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_002_HeyIDont=Hey, I don't mean to be rude or nothing, but the Nine Tails need this whole area clear. That holds true even for allies like you.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Deny_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_003_HeySorryAbout=Hey, sorry about this, but the Nine Tails don't want anyone flying out here, even you. I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Deny_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_004_HeyHowsIt=Hey, how's it going? We're crazy busy out here since the Nine Tails got something big going down. That's why I have to ask you to head back out. It's not safe for you to stick around.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Deny_aAlly_tPlayer_FromAlly_IG_005_SoHeresThe=So here's the deal. I know you're a friend of the Nine Tails and everything, but we really can't risk anybody getting in the way out here and messing things up. I'd appreciate it if you'd get out of here before there's an issue.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Deny_aNeutral_tPlayer_FromNeutral_IG_001_AttentionPilotThis=Attention, pilot. This here is Nine Tails' turf. Turn around and leave now or we will be forced to take action.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Deny_aNeutral_tPlayer_FromNeutral_IG_002_AllRightHere=All right, here's how it going to go. You leave and you live, you stay and you die. The choice is yours.
PU_NTPILOT05_M_DEP_Spotted_Vehicle_Deny_aNeutral_tPlayer_FromNeutral_IG_003_HeyImA=Hey. I'm a Nine Tails, so you better listen. You need to leave right now, okay? Or there's going to be trouble.

PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_EasyIsland_IG_001_ThesePlatformsAre=These platforms are Nine Tails territory now. We control the skies and we control the ground. I mean I knew it was only a matter of time before they sent someone in to try and take these back, but I really thought Crusader would at least try themselves before begging rando civilians to throw away their lives instead of risking their own. Anyway, I'm gonna tell you what I told them. I got people on every platform who are more than capable of handling some weekend warrior CDF scags like you. I'll give you one chance to get back on that shuttle, otherwise you're fair game.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_EasyIsland_IG_002_WhyTheHell=Why the hell do the CDF have to come in and wreck some good old-fashioned chaos? I mean, we're not messing with you, so why the hell do you wanna risk your life for those chickenshits at Crusader who don't even have the sack to defend their own territory? Take a second and think it over, we can blast any ship that comes near us out of the sky. I've got heavy-hitters locking down each of the platforms. You don't stand a chance, so just take my advice; get back on the shuttle, go home, and pop a Pips. You'll live longer.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_EasyIsland_IG_003_CrusadersEvenMore=Crusader's even more pathetic than we thought to rely on civvies to save their ass. We control the skies around all these platforms so there ain't nobody getting close that ain't a friend of Nine Tails and each island is controlled by someone you really don't want to be messing with, so best thing you can do is get back on that shuttle. It ain't your problem.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_FirstThresh_IG_001_YouProbablyThink=You probably think you're making good progress so far. And yeah, maybe we started off underestimating you, but don't worry, that'll change.

PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_LastThresh_IG_001_WhyTheHell=Why the hell won't you just die already? No bloody way am I'm losing to you CDF shitheads.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_LastThresh_IG_002_WhyWontYou=Why won't you all just walk away? You're acting like Crusader is someone worth protecting. Hell with it, we got something special cooked up for you.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_LastThresh_IG_003_GoddammitYouVolunteers=Goddammit! You volunteers couldn't just keep out of our business, could you? I got better things to do than deal with your stupid ass.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_MidThresh_IG_001_YouDontReally=You don't really think you're going to make a difference here, do you? Trust me, we're still in control here.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_MidThresh_IG_002_IGottaTell=I gotta tell ya, I'm getting pretty sick and tired of you interfering with Nine Tails business. Gloves are coming off.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionArea_MidThresh_IG_003_SoYouManaged=So you managed to slightly interupt our plans here, you want an award or something? Whatever, I'm getting tired of dealing with you. This ends now.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Approach_MissionBoss_IG_001_JustYouAnd=Just you and me now. Let's see what you've got.

PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_DeathThroe_MissionBoss_IG_003_YeahAllRight=Yeah, all right. That was a good scrap?

PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Intro_MissionObj_ToLT_EasyIsland_IG_003_RemyLookAlive=Remy, look alive. CDF's en route to your island. If they don't get back on that shuttle, you make 'em regret it.

PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Intro_MissionObj_ToLT_HardIsland_IG_002_AckerLookAlive=Acker, look alive. CDF's making their way to you.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Intro_MissionObj_ToLT_HardIsland_IG_003_GetYourGame=Get your game face on, Acker. You got some company.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Intro_MissionObj_ToLT_MedIsland_IG_001_NowYouGotta=Now you gotta deal with Scorch. You all right with that, Scorch?
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Intro_MissionObj_ToLT_MedIsland_IG_002_HeyScorchGot=Hey Scorch. Got some more kindling for you to burn.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Intro_MissionObj_ToLT_MedIsland_IG_003_ScorchImTrusting=Scorch, I'm trusting you to handle this. You got me?

PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Intro_MissionObj_ToLT_VeryHardIsland_IG_002_ItsUpTo=It's up to you, Stax. You got this?
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Intro_MissionObj_ToLT_VeryHardIsland_IG_003_YoureOnDeck=You're on deck, Stax. Watch out for this one, okay?
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Succeed_MissionObj_EasyIsland_IG_001_SolankiWasRemys=Solanki was Remy's first real assignment and to be honest, I hoped he'd at least be able to hold his own against some pissant volunteers, but I'll bitch him out about that when he regens. The CDF won't get that lucky again.
PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Succeed_MissionObj_EasyIsland_IG_002_YouMayHave=You may have taken out Remy, but he was a newby compared to what's coming, so don?t think it's gonna get any easier from here.

PU_NTSIEGECDR01_M_DEO_Succeed_MissionObj_HardIsland_IG_001_GoddammitIllAdmit=Goddammit? I'll admit, I wasn't expecting Acker to get punched out like that. You CDF just won't quit, will you?
