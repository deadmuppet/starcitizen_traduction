HurstonSecurity_RepUI_Description=As Hurston Dynamics continued to expand their manufacturing operations in the 25th century, it became necessary to hire more security personnel to protect valuable stock, monitor employee safety, and guard shipments. Rather than shoulder the continued expense of outsourcing, Hurston would create an internal security force to take over these duties. When Hurston acquired the rights to Stanton I in 2865, it was only natural for their own security personnel to take over the responsibility of ensuring the peace and safety of the planet. A common sight on the streets of Lorville, members of Hurston Security are an imposing presence able to quickly respond when the need arises.

IAE2951_Sign_Aegis_01_body=Few companies have had as tumultuous a history as Aegis Dynamics. From its earliest days manufacturing iconic warships of the First Tevarin War through the darkest days of the Messer regime, Aegis ships have found a resurgence in the public eye for their versatility and robust construction.
IAE2951_Sign_Aegis_01_title=ICONIC VERSATILITY
IAE2951_Sign_Aegis_02_body=No ship manufacturer personifies this year's theme better than Aegis Dynamics. Whether you're running cargo in a Retaliator or providing security in a Gladius, Aegis ships are putting in work in every corner of the 'verse. Regardless of the controversies that have plagued them over the centuries, pilots continue to trust their lives and livelihood to their tried and true designs.
IAE2951_Sign_Aegis_02_title=TRIED AND TRUE
IAE2951_Sign_Aegis_03_body=Establishing fire superiority can be the key to victory. Aegis designers consulted with both active and former members of the UEE military as well as security forces to find out what was and wasn't currently represented in the latest generation of combat gunships. The result? The Aegis Redeemer. Originally debuted years ago, Aegis made the somewhat controversial decision to delay the release of this battlefield equalizer to redesign the interior.
IAE2951_Sign_Aegis_03_title=KEY TO VICTORY
IAE2951_Sign_Anvil_01_body=Anvil Aerospace may have made a name for itself along the frontlines with its masterfully built fleet of military craft, but more and more of the company's civilian craft have captured the imagination of the Empire. Look no further than the Anvil Carrack to see a ship that has transitioned easily from its Naval origins to the very edges of space as pilots use the ship to chart new territory.
IAE2951_Sign_Anvil_01_title=CHART NEW TERRITORY
IAE2951_Sign_Anvil_02_body=As the war against the Vanduul continues, many pilots find themselves seeking a way to protect their home and loved ones during these uncertain times. Anvil Aerospace has been a strong ally in this endeavor, creating civilian versions of their popular military craft, like the Hornet F7-C, to protect you and the ones you care about. 
IAE2951_Sign_Anvil_02_title=STRONG ALLY
IAE2951_Sign_Anvil_03_body=Despite the Aerospace in its name, Anvil has hardly been limited to the skies. For example, the tough and rugged Atlas vehicle platform was developed to help conquer the unforgiving landscape found on moons and planets alike. Both the Ballista and the Spartan were both built from this design foundation, proving its adaptability.
IAE2951_Sign_Anvil_03_title=TOUGH AND RUGGED
IAE2951_Sign_Argo_01_body=Contrary to popular belief, Argo Astronautics name doesn't come from the ancient water craft of Earth mythology, but rather is derived from the initials of the company's founder Alana Redmond and is attributed to her mother.
IAE2951_Sign_Argo_01_title=TRUE ORIGINS
IAE2951_Sign_Argo_02_body=If you're looking to crack into the cargo hauling market, look no further than Argo's new RAFT. This small multi-crew ship utilizes Argo's experience in the industrial ship market and a versatile design to create an affordable entry-level ship that's ready for the long haul.
IAE2951_Sign_Argo_02_title=VERSATILE EXPERIENCE
IAE2951_Sign_Banu_body=It's not uncommon for Human manufacturers to offer unique features and designs to make their ships stand out from the crowd, but the Banu take a slightly different approach when it comes to crafting their vehicles. Heavily and freely borrowing from each other and even other species, Banu ships are made by combining the best features and best technology that they can get their hands on. 
IAE2951_Sign_Banu_title=BORROWED FREELY
IAE2951_Sign_Best_body=Selected by popular vote, the IAE Best in Show line up is a chance for your favorite ships to take center stage at the expo. At least most of the time. At the 2938 Expo, that year's winners were all ships too large to actually fit inside the show hall!
IAE2951_Sign_Best_title=BIGGER ISN'T ALWAYS BETTER
IAE2951_Sign_CO_body=One of the newer ship manufacturers to debut at the IAE, Consolidated Outlands has already made its mark on the Expo when it introduced the first ever mobile construction yard in 2947. The Pioneer opened up exciting opportunities for planetary settlement by allowing settlers to create their own modular structures, and forever changing the idea of what a spacecraft could do.
IAE2951_Sign_CO_title=MODULAR IDEAS
IAE2951_Sign_Crusader_01_body=Crusader Industries continues to surprise ship enthusiasts around the empire. Initially known for their commercial transports like the Genesis Starliner and the Hercules Starlifter, Crusader has been expanding into the civilian market with the introduction of their Ares Star Fighter and Mercury Star Runner. Needless to say, the future is bright for this titan of astro-engineering.
IAE2951_Sign_Crusader_01_title=BRIGHT FUTURE
IAE2951_Sign_Crusader_02_body=Unlike many of their competitors, Crusader Industries dedicates as much effort on their employees as they do on their products. Recognized as one of the UEE's best employers in 2943 and 2946, Crusader not only offers competitive pay and benefit programs to all employees, but also houses extensive in-house  training and education programs to foster talent and take their workers to the next level of their career.
IAE2951_Sign_Crusader_02_title=TOP TALENT
IAE2951_Sign_Crusader_03_body=Although Crusader Industries might be best known for their transports, their recent introduction of the Ares Star Fighter shows that the charity-minded manufacturer is taking a new approach to helping citizens across the Empire, and more specifically those who live on Crusader itself. With recent attacks by well outfitted groups like XenoThreat and the Nine Tails becoming all too common, its easy to see why a powerhouse like the Ares was added to their line-up.
IAE2951_Sign_Crusader_03_title=NEW POWERHOUSE
IAE2951_Sign_Drake_01_body=Mention the name Drake Interplanetary in a room and you're sure to kick off some debate. To some, they're villains, arming the most dangerous elements in the 'verse with the tools to wreak havoc. But did you know that this criminal connection was only made possible because Drake ships were so common? In the infamous Kesselring Heist of 2903, a Drake caterpillar was used specifically because it was easy to blend in with the masses in flight.
IAE2951_Sign_Drake_01_title=ONE OF THE CROWD
IAE2951_Sign_Drake_02_body=No one brings the thunder to IAE quite like Drake Interplanetary. Love 'em or hate 'em, their ships have become versatile and affordable options for everyone from security and militia forces to haulers trying to scrape a living out in the black. The Drake Red medic ship was recently recognized for the 'most lives saved' thanks to the ship's usage in medstations and hospitals around the UEE. 
IAE2951_Sign_Drake_02_title=LIFESAVER
IAE2951_Sign_Drake_03_body=Introduced in 2887, Drake's Buccaneer almost begs its pilots to pick a fight. While it doesn't have the versatility of something like the Hornet, the Bucc's got heart... and enough firepower to make it a serious threat in any engagement. Though it's been associated with multiple crimes throughout the Empire, it's also become a mainstay for local security forces and militias looking to keep the peace.
IAE2951_Sign_Drake_03_title=READY TO FIGHT
IAE2951_Sign_Esperia_body=Though the Expo attracts the latest innovations and technological wonders, Esperia is constantly paving the way forward with their reverence of the past. Preserving important historical craft and xeno-vehicles, Esperia defines spaceflight in entirely new ways by providing unique experiences that would otherwise be unavailable to modern pilots.
IAE2951_Sign_Esperia_title=HISTORICAL REVERENCE
IAE2951_Sign_FPS_body=You may be wondering why an Expo focused on vehicles and spacecraft would want to highlight personal armor and weapons. While its true that getting there is half the fun, what you do when you arrive is just as important. Having the perfect gear on board will help ensure that a landed pilot will be ready to take off again soon.
IAE2951_Sign_FPS_title=GEAR UP
IAE2951_Sign_Greycat_body=Greycat Industrial holds the distinction of having the most ever vehicles at a single IAE when in 2926 a thousand buggy parade was driven through the streets of Severus. The highlight was when all of the buggy's sounded their horns together to play a rendition of the Imperial anthem. 
IAE2951_Sign_Greycat_title=IMPERIAL PRIDE
IAE2951_Sign_MISC_01_body=It's common knowledge that MISC builds some of the hardest working ships around, but to get that tough a lot of thought and careful consideration had to go into even the smallest of details. To find the best panel adhesive, MISC ran over a million thermocycle shock tests at their R&D center. The winner alone was able to survive tens of thousands of cycles without failing. Talk about being built to last.
IAE2951_Sign_MISC_01_title=CAREFUL CONSIDERATION
IAE2951_Sign_MISC_02_body=Represented in almost every industry, MISC continues to create reliable, durable, and versatile ships at a variety of pricepoints. One of their toughest tests is known affectionately as the "Meat Grinder." Though the specifics of the test are a proprietary secret, insiders claim that the test aims to inundate the prototype ship with nearly three dozen adverse conditions, sometimes attacking with three to four at the same time in an effort to prove that their ship can survive the harshest of the harsh conditions.
IAE2951_Sign_MISC_02_title=DURABLE RELIABILITY
IAE2951_Sign_MISC_03_body=MISC's latest addition to their already impressive line of ships perfectly encapsulates the spirit of this year's IAE. Push the boundaries of the known universe with their new multi-crew wayfarer ship, the Odyssey. Get a sneak peek in the holoviewer room. Only at the IAE.
IAE2951_Sign_MISC_03_title=BOUNDARY PUSHING
IAE2951_Sign_Origin_01_body=Luxury. Elegance. Performance. These are only a handful of the terms that are regularly associated with Origin Jumpworks ships. Since the 28th century, Origin has consistently pushed the boundaries of speed and sophistication, but did you know that their controversial decision to uproot their headquarters from Earth to Terra in 2913 nearly sank the company?
IAE2951_Sign_Origin_01_title=SPEED AND SOPHISTICATION
IAE2951_Sign_Origin_02_body=Perpetually expanding what's possible when it comes to high-end performance vehicles, Origin Jumpworks is a fan favorite at the IAE and this year's lineup is sure to impress. When attempting to design a new addition to their roster, Origin engineers have looked for inspiration from a variety of sources. For example, when initially brainstorming designs that would ultimately become the X1, Engineering Director Alberto Vara looked to musical notes to dictate the potential shape language of the open-canopy racer.
IAE2951_Sign_Origin_02_title=ENDLESS INSPIRATION
IAE2951_Sign_Origin_03_body=Initially concepted to be a competitor for RSI's classic Constellation line, Origin's 400i quickly developed  its own singular identity. Utilizing Origin's usual high standards of performance and comfort, the 400i evolved into a ship for explorers who didn't feel the need to 'rough it' while pushing the boundaries of the known.
IAE2951_Sign_Origin_03_title=SINGULAR IDENTITY
IAE2951_Sign_Pilots_body=While it may be commonplace to sail through the stars, we should never lose sight of the wonders of space flight from discovering new jump points, unearthing lost ruins, or setting new speed records. Famed artist, Aruto Divani, created this unique portrait series as a tribute to the diverse array of people who eagerly climb aboard their ships and 'Dare to Fly.'
IAE2951_Sign_Pilots_title=SAIL THE STARS
IAE2951_Sign_RSI_01_body=Some historians credit Roberts Space Industries with the invention of modern spaceflight. For founder Chris Roberts, the prospect of making space travel more accessible was a lifelong dream and when his company unveiled their prototype Quantum Core Engine in 2075, suddenly, space travel didn’t seem that fantastical anymore.
IAE2951_Sign_RSI_01_title=DREAMS ACCOMPLISHED
IAE2951_Sign_RSI_02_body=It's pretty amazing to think that RSI makes one of the smallest ships on the market and one of the biggest. It would take about 50 Auroras laid end to end to equal the length of one mighty Bengal carrier. 
IAE2951_Sign_RSI_02_title=SMALLEST TO BIGGEST
IAE2951_Sign_RSI_03_body=Since its introduction in 2712, the RSI Constellation has been reimagined countless times, proving itself as varied and long-lived as Roberts Space Industries itself. It has been a cargo hauler, an explorer, a luxury liner, and more. When asked what's next for the Constellation, RSI Designer Deshondra Lewin said "Whatever it is, we will always strive to balance innovation with the tested features that pilots have come to rely upon." 
IAE2951_Sign_RSI_03_title=RELIABLE INNOVATION
IAE2951_Sign_Theme_body=The theme of this year's expo is "Dare to Fly" which celebrates the courage of pilots everywhere who boldly take flight to discover new thrills, to seek adventure, and to push boundaries farther than ever imagined. With the right ship and the right frame of mind, anything is possible.
IAE2951_Sign_Theme_title=DARE TO FLY
IAE2951_Sign_Welcome_body=Hello and welcome to the 2951 Intergalactic Aerospace Expo. This special audio presentation will be your guide to the ins and outs of the various halls and provide unique insight about the vehicles and manufacturers on display. Thanks for listening and we hope you enjoy your time with us here at this year's IAE.
IAE2951_Sign_Welcome_title=WELCOME
IAE2951_Sign_Xian_body=Xi'an ships are becoming a more common sight across the UEE, but it wasn't too long ago that their sale was completely forbidden by the Xi'an Emperor. Now, thanks to growing trade between our two species, Xi'an manufacturers like Gatac and Aopoa are producing vehicles specifically for Humans to pilot. Even more promising, some new ships have been designed for Human and Xi'an crew to serve along side each other. 
IAE2951_Sign_Xian_title=FLYABLE DIPLOMACY
IAE2952_Sign_CDFHeroes_body=For this year's IAE, we would like to honor the brave volunteers of the Civilian Defense Force who never fail to rise to whatever occasion calls for them.\n\nDriven by a sense of duty and a desire to protect their community, these heroes put their lives on the line as they foiled the Nine Tails' Siege of Orison, defended the INS Jericho from XenoThreat's attack, and provided humanitarian aid in the immediate aftermath of the catastrophic storm that struck Borea's western continent earlier this year.\n\nShould the need rise again, let the courage of these CDF volunteers be a reminder that we all have the potential to be heroes.
IAE2952_Sign_CDFHeroes_title=THE HEROES AMONG US
IAE2952_Sign_CDFHistory_body="A system's best defense will always come from its residents."\n\nSpecial Agent-in-Charge Bryce Balewa argued this point for years before becoming a leading proponent for the Civilian Defense Force (CDF), a volunteer militia called upon by the UEE military and Advocacy to provide support during times of crisis. His extensive experience in law enforcement convinced him a strong and trusted partnership between not only local security forces, the Advocacy, and the Navy, but also skilled individuals, would be the best security option for helping to safeguard the people of the UEE. In 2944, Balewa gave a speech at the Civilian Security Summit on this exact subject and was approached after by Amanda Xiang, a prominent lawyer and militia rights activist. Together, Balewa and Xiang drafted a proposal calling for the formation of the CDF so locals, either independently or as part of a militia, could be quickly deputized as provisional law enforcement in times of an emergency. The Civilian Defense Force was officially created in January of 2947 and after months of intensive planning, the fledgling organization had its first mission to help evacuate people on Tangaroa (Helios II) threatened by sudden and intense volcanic activity. Whether it’s defending shipping lanes from raids by increasingly aggressive outlaw packs or running relief to those affected by natural disasters, the CDF has quickly proven to be a vital part of system security across the empire and has become a beacon of the people’s power to overcome adversity when they work together.
IAE2952_Sign_CDFHistory_title=CREATING A BETTER DEFENSE
IAE2952_Sign_WarAtHome_body=THE LATEST FRONT IN THE FIGHT FOR SAFETY\n\nWhile the brave forces of the UEE work diligently to protect all of us from Empire-level threats, there are still ever-present dangers lurking closer to home. Millions of innocent people across every system find themselves in a daily struggle for their very lives against a surge of crime at a level unprecedented in the history of Humanity.  \n\nConsidered trivial by some, compared to the Empire’s war against the Vanduul, this growing wave of violence has remained unchecked for far too long. With the recent heinous actions of criminal gangs like the Nine Tails and XenoThreat, Drake Interplanetary has partnered with the Intergalactic Aerospace Expo to bring attention to this ongoing struggle, and to provide you with the resources you need to claim your strength and protect what's yours. \n\nTogether, and armed with the right ships and equipment, we can take the power back and win this war.
IAE2952_Sign_WarAtHome_title=THE WAR AT HOME
IAE952_Sign_Commander_body=This armor set is an accurate reproduction of the one worn by the infamous leader of the XenoThreat terrorist group simply known as "Commander." With their true identity currently unknown, they are believed to be still at large in the Pyro system.
IAE952_Sign_Commander_title=Armor of XenoThreat Commander
IAE952_Sign_Mendo_body=This detailed reproduction faithfully recreates the armor worn by Mendo Ren, a longtime member of the Nine Tails had been tied to dozens of robberies and murders across the Stanton system before leading the recent Siege of Orison.
IAE952_Sign_Mendo_title=Armor of Mendo Ren
IAE952_Sign_Pressley_body=A small New Babbage event rental service that went out of business in 2944, the Nine Tails used crates belonging to the defunct Pressley Party Supply Co. to smuggle in weapons and technology onto Inspiration Park in preparation for their recent attack.
IAE952_Sign_Pressley_title=Pressley Party Supply Co.
IAE952_Sign_Resupply_body=After a brutal XenoThreat attack against Naval supply ships, CDF Volunteers were instrumental in restocking INS-Jericho with much needed crates of Zeta Prolanide, Diluthermex, and Acryliplex despite the difficulty in transporting such sensitive materials.

HOW CAN I LEARN MORE ABOUT MY SENTENCE?\n\nIf you ever would like to find out information regarding your sentence, feel free to check the 'YOUR SENTENCE' tab on the information terminal. From this tab you can check:\n\n• Merits Earned: Keep track of the number of merits earned through our work-release program.\n\n• Remaining Time Until Release: An accurate countdown until your release. \n\n• Time Served: The amount of time you’ve been a guest in our facility.\n\n• Sentence Extensions: If your original sentence has been extended due to guideline infractions, you can find a list of those extensions and the reasons. \n\n2. CAN I SHORTEN MY STAY?\n\nThis Klescher Rehabilitation Facility offers a variety of work-release programs that will keep our guests busy during their stay. \n\n• Mining: This underground Klescher facility offers our guests a unique opportunity to earn merits and shave time off their sentence by mining commodities in the nearby tunnels and depositing them in the mineral deposit hoppers. You will be issued a time reduction chit or "merit" based on the total value of the deposit.*\n\n• Maintenance Tasks: We will pay guests in merits to fix up faulty equipment around the facility. \n\nFurther details can be found on your mobiGlas.\n\n3. WHAT IF I NEED SUPPLIES?\n\nCommissary Dispensers contain a selection of food, drinks, and other useful items to make your stay more comfortable that may be purchased with merits earned through our work-release programs. These dispensers are conveniently placed around the entrances to the work mines.\n\n4. IS VIOLENCE EVER THE ANSWER?\n\nViolence is never the answer. Any violence committed against Klescher personnel or your fellow guests is strictly forbidden and will result in an immediate extension of your original sentence.\n\n5. WHAT IF I WANT TO ESCAPE?\n\nWhile we understand the desire, any attempt to prematurely end your term in our facility is strictly forbidden, as is using your mobiGlas to communicate with anyone outside the facility. Failing to adhere to either of these guidelines will result in an extension of your original sentence.\n\n*Mineral prices are static and set by Klescher Company and do not reflect real-world commodity prices.\n

Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_MidDeck_01_Body=Lovingly referred to as "warhalwa" by the crew, the UEES War Hammer has had one special dish on its mess hall menu since the ship entered service in 2832. This carrot halwa, a sweet, cardamom-spiced pudding, was the special request by the War Hammer’s first Captain, Omar Singh, in celebration of his birthday. It has since become a tradition among the crew to eat this dessert on special occasions and celebrations. Lt. Con Timway credited the carrots in the dish for setting the new naval accuracy record in 2902.
Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_MidDeck_01_Title=THE WAR HAMMER’S SIGNATURE DESSERT
Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_MidDeck_02_Body=On July 7, 2884, the UEES War Hammer was part of the naval defensive action against the Vanduul now commonly known as the "Fall of Caliban." While providing cover for the civilian evacuation of the system, the turrets were fired so frequently and for such an extended duration that XO Sander Freelin’s after action report noted that "turret support struts had begun to warp from the heat of the sustained fire." Gunner Tobin Lemk commented in a letter home, "I could hear my sweat sizzle as it dripped off me." As a result, Aegis Dynamics reworked the cooling systems in future Javelin models.
Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_MidDeck_02_Title=THE FALL OF CALIBAN
Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_MidDeck_03_Body=While no sign of the incursion remains, the UEES War Hammer was boarded in a surprise assault on June 25, 2861 when a Vanduul boarding ship, known in the Navy as "Spikes," made it past the UEES War Hammer’s point defense systems and punctured the hull. While five off-duty starmen tragically perished in the first moments of the assault, the crew were able to rally and overwhelm the Vanduul boarders before they managed to gain control of any vital parts of the ship. These brave starmen were instrumental in the War Hammer’s eventual victory that day.
Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_MidDeck_03_Title=IN MEMORY OF THOSE LOST
Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_MidDeck_04_Body=Among the crew of the UEES War Hammer, the first step of this stairwell is commonly known as the "Skip Step." For a brief period in 2928, the gravity plate located directly below the step was intermittently malfunctioning. This resulted in numerous starmen tripping and stumbling as they used the stairwell. As a health hazard, repairs were immediately done but despite numerous attempts at correcting the issue, the problem kept returning. During this time the crew formed a habit of not utilizing the first step as a precaution. In the end, it turned out to be a software issue in the gravity controls, but the tradition of hopping over the "skip step" remains today.
Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_MidDeck_04_Title=ONE SMALL STEP
Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_TopDeck_01_Body=Ever since the line’s introduction in 2690, the Javelin has been a brawler. Unlike other ships that can fulfill multiple roles like transport, the engineers at Aegis Dynamics clearly intended for this ship to put itself in harm’s way. Aside from the turret installations that line these halls, the Javelin comes fully stocked with heavy ordnance to challenge capital ships and a complement of Marines to raise hell on the ground. Simply put, the Javelin is a fighter.
Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_TopDeck_01_Title=A HEAVY HITTER ON THE BATTLEFIELD
Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_TopDeck_02_Body="I remember the exact moment that I stepped aboard the UEES War Hammer for the first time. To me, it was already a legendary ship. Sure, most people dream about serving aboard the Krugeri or something, but I’d grown up hearing about the War Hammer. My dad served on it immediately after graduation, so I think the thing that struck me most was its sense of history. This was a ship that’s distinguished itself in some of the biggest military operations of the past hundred years and the crew always seemed to carry that shared sense of duty to live up to the high standards set by the last generation of crewmembers. I could see why it had such a profound effect on my father and why it continues to have a profound effect on me."\n- Adelle Marker, Leading Starman
Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_TopDeck_02_Title=A PROUD LINEAGE
Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_TopDeck_03_Body=As you’ve been exploring the halls of this famed vessel, here are some facts that you might not have known:\n\n- Since its sealing in 2832, over 5000 Naval and Marine personnel have served aboard the War Hammer. Some notable crew members include: Ari Barber (actor, served as gunner 2854-2857), Natalya Jesui (pilot, served as navigator 2905-2911), Lee Cardenza (Sataball player, served as mechanic 2932-2935).\n\n- There’s a tradition among Captains of the War Hammer to leave a bottle of liquor and a blank paper journal in their quarters for their successor. This originated with Captain Lionel Ross, who took over from Captain Singh, as the War Hammer’s second captain.\n\n- The Aegis Javelin uses over six million meters of cable for its electrical, data, and automation systems. That’s almost the distance from Moscow to Shanghai on Earth.\n
Invictus2951_JavelinTourScreens_TopDeck_03_Title=DID YOU KNOW?
Invictus_999SquadTerm=SQUADRON 999 F8 LIGHTNING\n\nThe F8 Lightning was developed by Anvil Aerospace as a replacement for the previous generation F7A Hornet fighter. The UEE selected the Anvil Lightning for production because of the Hornet's string of military successes and its overall familiarity with active pilots. The Lightning was developed specifically to counter what the military saw as the rising Vanduul threat of the 2940s, intended to outfly and outfight the current generation of Scythe and Glaive spacecraft. \n\nTo put this new craft through its paces, the Navy's elite test unit, Squadron 999 were given full access to these next generation fighters. After dozens of flights and simulated battles, the skilled "Wreckless" pilots of the 999 provided valuable feedback that helped hone the Lightning into this imposing vehicle poised to make history.

I knew you’d be against talking to them, but I couldn’t risk it not happening. You have every right to be angry at me for keeping it from you, but you know how you get sometimes. Honestly, I don’t know how to handle you when you get all worked up. You’ve been that way since we were kids. Remember that incident with Mom’s Cutlass? Guess I wanted to avoid all that drama until everything was official. \n\nSee... dammit, it’s hard to admit this to you ... Freund Family Fuel is running deep in the red and I don’t see a way out. I did… I did everything I could to try and find a way out, put the house up as collateral for a loan… but nothing worked. Just dumb luck I guess. \n\nSelling to Avivar is our only option to stay flying with some creds in our pockets and a shred of dignity. I know you’d argue with all your heart against it, but you don’t know the numbers like I do. This system’s a different place since Dad started all of this. Dad never had to hire a full time turret gunner for protection. Competition’s grown so fierce that the low fuel prices can’t cover our skyrocketing costs. At least if we operate under Avivar’s banner we’ll have some support during these tough times. The business may not be in our name after this, but it’ll still be ours.\n\nI know you hate me right now, but just remember that, as your brother, I love you and only want to do what’s best for all of us. Well, whenever you’re ready to talk, I’ll be here.\n\n-	J     \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

Three runs. I’ve done three runs for you and still haven’t gotten paid. You aren’t the only ones with debts to pay and while this may be your family business, it sure as hell isn’t mine.  \n\nMaybe if you guys actually made sure your clients paid on time this wouldn’t happen. More than once I’ve seen Jameis tell clients to pay him whenever it’s convenient. Guess I shouldn’t be surprised this happened. Freund Family Fuel may be fine with doing a hard day’s work and not getting paid, but the hell if I am. I’ll be filing a breach of contract or lost wages complaint or whatever the hell they’re called against you both the second I’m off this tub. \n\n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

Guess I didn’t get to the turret fast enough. Adena kept yelling at me that we’d all be dead if the ship was really under attack. \n\nBut it’s not like I was dragging my heels. I’ve just never been on a ship this size before. It’s so easy to get turned around on this thing. Almost feels like someone designed this ship specifically for people to get lost on.\n\nTy keeps telling me not to worry about it. He keeps reminding me that nobody’s first run goes smoothly. Told me yesterday that “the only way you learn is by living.” This would all be super overwhelming if he wasn’t here. Not to say it’s not nice to talk to you about these things too, but by the time the message reaches you and you have the time to respond, sometimes the moment’s passed.   \n\nHeard the Captain and his sister arguing again last night. I’m not sure if they realize how loud they are or maybe they don’t care. Had to crank up the volume on my mobi to drown them out, but then I got worried I’d miss a call to get to the turret, so I turned it back down. Still not sleeping very well. Every little bump wakes me up, then it takes forever to get back to sleep. \n\nAt least I’m making some creds and gaining some experience. Once I get paid, I’ll send a portion to Mom. Maybe now that both of us are working things will be a bit easier for her. Oh, did you ever find out how much experience deckhands need on your ship? How great would that be to work this same ship. Sure Mom would love it too. Both her boys, exploring the stars together. Just like she always dreamed. \n\nCrap … gotta run. Talk again soon, brother.   \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

I’ve done a full assessment of the ship in its current state and come to a ballpark value. It … well, there’s a lot more work to be done around here than I first thought. I added about half a dozen other fixes to my punch list today... you know what, we should probably talk about this in person. That way I can explain how I got to my total. Fair warning, I don’t think you’ll be thrilled with the news.\n\nI know you told me to hold off on repairs for the time being, but I noticed something today that’s a little worrying. The power plant’s having power spikes under normal operations. Could be a busted regulator or something, but it’s best not to strain the system until I figure out what’s going on. Might have to do with those repairs I did to the shield genny the other day. Won’t know until I run a full diagnostic.\n\nAlso, I tweaked a few things on the turret for the kid. He wouldn’t stop complaining about how slow and unresponsive it was, so I made a few minor adjustments just to keep him quiet about it. Kid’s eager, and works his tail off, but he’s as green as they come.       \n\nOne last thing, I’ve been thinking about your last message, taking Avivar’s buyout seems like the best plan. Know your Dad wouldn’t be happy about it, but he’d understand.   \n\nOh, and tell your sister before you go through with it. She definitely won’t like it, but you owe her that much.  \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

This has been a good week for Avivar in the Stanton System. I closed that contract I was telling you about last week. Had to cut them a deal, but like you say, once they experience Avivar’s amazing service, we’ve got ‘em for good. That gives us three in the system. A few more clients like this and we’ll be turning a profit in no time. \n\nIn other good news, I’ve been able to convince a local fuel concern, Freund Family Fuel, to meet with me about a possible buyout. They’ve been around for decades and have a number of primo contracts. I’ve drafted the offer so it allows them to operate under the Avivar name as long as they maintain our standards. Considering the state of their ship and employee records, it shouldn’t be hard to get rid of them following the first performance review. It’s their contracts that we really want. Not their aging Starfarer. Will let you know when I’m closing in on a deal so you can give it final approval. \n\nI know I’ve only been here a few months, but I see a lot of potential for Avivar in Stanton and have some big plans. Just give me the time and I’ll give you this system. \n\nI’ll be in touch next week. \n\n-	Patricia    \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

I don’t have to tell you how important it is for the company that our expansion into the system succeeds. \n\nWith that in mind, I must say that I have my concerns over how Ms. Sarafian is handling the situation. One of my main problems in making an educated assessment is a lack of good information. Ms. Sarafian, despite a number of subtle and not to subtle requests, only submits her required weekly report for me to review. \n\nThat’s where I was hoping you could come in. For here forward, I need you to provide me with a day-by-day accounting of Avivar’s happenings in the system without informing Ms. Sarafian that you are doing so. I reviewed your personnel file and see that you have been an excellent Avivar employee over the years. Since you have been so good to us, you can expect Avivar to be good to you for your assistance and discretion in this matter. \n\n-	MD \n\n//**TRANSCRIPTION_END**//

I was just on the bridge for the last few hours, bored outta my mind, and it hit me like a lightning bolt. Had to sneak away so I could get this idea to you before I forgot it. \n\nWhat if, at the end of the party scene, we reveal the ship has a smuggler’s compartment that Hector didn’t know about. So he’s had the magical relic on board the entire time. That’s why the pirates don’t want to damage the ship and destroy what’s onboard. \n\nPlus, it gives ‘em a reason to board the ship and take him hostage instead of blowing him out of the sky. Then we can keep that scene we love where he’s locked in that cell and ...\n\nI gotta run. Cap keeps yelling for me over comm. But you get the idea, right?

Journal_General_ContractManagerTutorial_Content=Welcome to the new Contract Manager!\n\nWith your mobiGlas’ 2.5 network software update, you may have noticed some improvements made to the Contract Manager application. It’s now easier to search through available jobs, accept contracts, and keep all your ongoing work organized. Happy Job Hunting!\n_______________________________________\n\nKEEPING TABS\n\nThe first thing you may notice when you open the Contract Manager from the mG Homespace is that there are now four tabs located along the top of your holo-display.\n\nGeneral - This tab gathers and displays available local contracts which have been Business and Labor Administration (BLA) certified to meet UEE and local law requirements.  \nPersonal - These are offers being sent to your account specifically. Users are encouraged to be cautious accepting unsolicited contracts from unknown sources.\nAccepted - Once you accept an offer, the contract is moved to this tab so that you can quickly access important information relating to it.\nHistory - When a contract comes to end, either through successful completion or by other means, the record of it is kept here for reference.\n\nNEW CONTRACT CATEGORIES\n\nWe have introduced new Contract Categories that automatically group offers by type to make it easier to find the type of job you’re interested in. \n\nAppointments - These are typically offers used to coordinate and schedule in person meetings.\nBounty Hunter - Contracts to pursue and track down specific, possibly dangerous individuals.\nECN - Contracts received through the Emergency Communication Network system.\nDelivery - Transport-related contracts to move cargo and goods between locations.\nInvestigation - Used by insurance companies and individuals to acquire information. (This update also improves the data submission tool to allow users to submit applicable information to the client from the Accepted tab*.)\nMaintenance - Jobs that require manual labor and trade skills such as repair work or hazardous material handling. \nMercenary - Offers in which the contractor is expected to have combat training, such as escort and security work.\n\nACCEPTING CONTRACTS\n\nWith the Contract Manager, after carefully reading all the information, you can apply for and accept job offers** directly from your mobiGlas. Once you have accepted a contract, from the Accepted tab you will be able to see a detailed list of objectives, and can now also track and untrack contracts to have it sync with your StarMap app, as well as cancel contracts already in progress***.\n_______________________________________\n\n* Users may choose to submit their data to the client at any point, whether the matter has been fully investigated or not. Any complications to arise from this are the solely the responsibility of the user.\n** microTech and mobiGlas do not endorse or guarantee any contracts listed in the Contract Manager and are not responsible for any risks associated with accepting uncertified contracts. \n*** microTech and mobiGlas are not accountable for any and all repercussions related to abandoning contracts.

Journal_General_CrusaderCrimeTutorial_Content=Like many who travel to the Stanton System, you may be wondering how the laws and regulations of the four megacorps compare to the laws in the rest of the UEE. While our status as an independent planet allows us latitude to govern as we see fit, you may be surprised to learn that Crusader Industries adheres to many of the legal guidelines set forth by the Empire in order to provide a safe and secure environment for all.  \n\nHere are few tips to remember while visiting Crusader and its surrounding sectors:\n\n* While the level of crime here is typically no higher than many places in the Empire, visitors should be cautious traveling to more remote areas such as the asteroid belt around the moon Yela since outlaw attacks have been known to occur.\n\n* Even though you are in Crusader Security patrolled space, damaging another individual’s ship or interfering with public landing areas are still considered misdemeanors. Note that repeated offenses will be taken very seriously.   \n\n* Beware of contract offers that involve the disabling of comm arrays. Unsavory individuals often try to lure unsuspecting victims to do this illegal task for them under false pretenses, and many travellers have fallen for this scam. Know that TAMPERING WITH COMM ARRAYS IS AGAINST THE LAW and endangers other people’s lives. Anyone caught disabling a comm array will be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law.\n\n* The moons of Crusader are home to many beautiful sights, and touring them is a must while visiting the area. Just be sure to avoid unmarked outposts, bring plenty of fuel and oxygen, and always locate your closest emergency shelter before setting out an expedition.\n\n* Crusader Security encourages individuals to join us in helping promote a safe environment. Whether you help track down a wanted criminal, assist in patrolling nearby sectors, or respond to ECN alerts to help ships in distress, any contributions you make to the community’s overall security will be noted in your records and may go a long way in making up for any previous minor infractions. By working together we can all make Crusader a better place to visit.

Journal_General_Healing_Content=Since its recent introduction, there’s no denying that regeneration technology has changed modern medicine for the better. Across the Empire, patients can now recover from injuries that would have been fatal in the past. However, as impressive as regeneration is, it is not a replacement for traditional care and treatments.\n\nBelow, we will outline a few important tips on regeneration along with some basic medical practices to help safeguard your health.\n\n--REGENERATION--\n\nRegeneration is the medical process in which a holistic bioscan known as an ‘imprint’ is used to recreate a near perfect copy of someone down to their memories. Because of the unique properties of the imprint, it maintains a remote connection to its source at all times and ensures that it can only regenerate someone after they experience a fatal event. \n\nThis connection, known as an ‘echo’, also means that traumatic experiences lower an Imprint’s Viability Score (IVS). Repeated regeneration may produce irregularities during the regeneration process and eventually render the imprint unusable.    \n\nTo create your very own imprint, visit a Tier 1 or Tier 2 medical facility and register on a kiosk. Once complete, that site will then be where you next regenerate. You can also store an imprint aboard a properly equipped vehicle. If the location or vehicle where your imprint is stored becomes unavailable, a back-up will always be available at your primary residence and you will regenerate there. Please note that having an active CrimeStat may have an impact on your regeneration site.\n\nHowever, because of the effect of imprint echoes on the regeneration process, it is important to remember that receiving first aid and medical treatment is always preferable to being regenerated. The following breakdown outlines basic first aid to deal with a variety of injuries to help avoid needing to regenerate.\n\n--FIRST AID--\n\nThe first step when dealing with an injury is to identify how serious it is using a visor HUD, a self-evaluation (i.e. PIT), or if assisting someone else, a medical device. All injuries can be divided into three severity categories:\n\n- Minor injuries can be treated by Tier 3 (T3) medical facilities and are highlighted purple.\n\n- Moderate injuries can be treated Tier 2 (T2) medical facilities and are highlighted mauve.\n\n- Severe injuries can be treated by Tier 1 (T1) medical facilities and are highlighted pink.\n\nTo fully treat an injury, seek out an appropriately tiered facility at a rest stop, landing zone, or medically equipped vehicle. Attempting treatment at an incorrectly tiered facility can temporarily relieve symptoms, but the injury itself will remain. If you are alone and in need of transportation to a medical facility, you should contact a trusted acquaintance or use your mobiGlas to create a rescue service beacon.\n\nWhile injuries can only be treated at an appropriate medical facility, medication can be administered on site to temporarily alleviate associated symptoms. Before heading out a trip, it’s smart to bring along single dose pens, medical attachments, or full healing device with you.\n\nInjection pens are easy to carry and administer, but you will need to bring multiple pens to cover various symptoms and they can only be used once.\n\nSmaller medical attachments, like the LifeGuard for the Pyro Multi-Tool, allow for diagnostic scans and can administer a healing agent like Hemozal, but cannot treat other symptoms. They are typically used in conjunction with injection pens. \n\nFull medical devices like the ParaMed from CureLife provide detailed diagnostic scans and allows for the administration of multiple medicines along with full control of the dosage. However, it can be bulkier and more expensive than other options.\n\nFor ease of reference, here is an alphabetical list of common symptoms and the recommended medicines to relieve them.\n\n--COMMON SYMPTOMS--\n\n- Concussion – Caused by an impact to the head, individuals with a concussion will experience slower reaction times and have a harder time maintaining their balance. Can be relieved with an adrenaline like Demexatrine. \n\n- Health Loss – As displayed on your mobiGlas or bioscan, your ‘health’ is a simplified diagnostic number derived by combining information from several important monitored vitals. Sustaining injuries will cause you to lose health. Health can be restored by administering a healing agent like Hemozal.\n\n- Impaired Mobility – Caused by injuries to the limbs, torso or head, impaired mobility will make getting around difficult. Can be relieved with an opioid like Roxaphen.\n\n- Incapacitation – Individuals who are incapacitated have had their health levels reduced to zero and will be unable to move. This is a potentially fatal condition and a healing agent like Hemozal must be applied must be applied in order to restore mobility. The amount of time until the condition is irreversible will be displayed on your mobiGlas. Note that factors like sustaining additional injures or having other confounding medical issues may impact how long you have. \n\n- Muscle Fatigue – Caused by injuries to the limbs, those suffering from muscle fatigue will move slower and have their refined motor skills affected. Can be relieved with an adrenaline like Demexatrine.  \n\n- Muscle Weakness – Caused by injuries to the arms, muscle weakness makes it difficult to do activities that require strength. Can be relieved with a corticosteroid like Sterogen.\n\n- Ocular Inflammation – Caused by injuries to the head and results in vision obscured by inflamed blood vessels. Can be relieved by a corticosteroid like Sterogen.\n\n- Partial Paralysis – Caused by injures to the limbs, partial paralysis makes it so the affected area is severely impaired resulting in the loss of the ability to do activities like running, climbing, and interacting with objects. Can be relieved with an opioid like Roxaphen.\n\n- Respiratory Damage – Caused by injuries to the torso, this affects lung capacity and makes breathing or prolonged physical exertion very difficult. Can be relieved with a corticosteroid like Sterogen.\n\n- Stunned – A temporary loss of consciousness that leaves the individual unable to move for the duration. Will relieve itself after enough time passes and consciousness is regained.\n\n--BLOOD DRUG LEVEL AND OVERDOSE RISK—\n\nWhile giving first aid is vital, know that it comes with its own risks. Administering medication will increase an individual’s Blood Drug Level (BDL) as will imbibing recreational drugs or alcohol. \n\nA high BDL can create a feeling of intoxication and may result in difficulty moving, blurred vision, and loss of refined motor skills. For your safety and other, it is strongly recommended that you avoid operating a vehicle while intoxicated.\n\nOnce your BDL reaches a dangerous level it is called an overdose. Individuals experiencing an overdose will be stunned and will gradually lose health until they become incapacitated.\n\nFortunately, BDL will reduce naturally over time. Administering a detoxicant like Resurgera will speed the process and make it so you are no longer stunned. \n

Journal_General_Medical_Content=Whether you haven’t been sleeping well, experienced a traumatic injury, or have , most modern digital assistants like mobiGlas include a wide variety of health monitoring capabilities to make staying healthy simpler than ever.\n\nBy constantly monitoring your key vitals, the software is able to make preliminary diagnoses and alert you about dozens of afflictions you may be experiencing. These alerts, when used properly, can offer guidance and help you know when to make lifestyle adjustments, administer self-treatment options, or seek assistance from a medical professional.  \n\nBelow we have highlighted a few of the more common medical alerts that you may see:\n\nConcussed -\nA mild brain injury that results in temporary loss of cognitive function. Early warning signs of a concussion can include double vision, loss of balance, and ringing in the ears.\n\nDehydrated - \nWhen the body does not have enough water to function normally. Symptoms can include thirst, dry mouth, headaches, deteriorating health, exhaustion, and blurred vision.\n\nHemorrhage - \nInternal or external bleeding. It is recommended that you try to stem the loss of blood as soon as possible to minimize deterioration of health.\n\nHyperthermia - \nThe body’s core temperature has risen above safe levels and can no longer compensate leading towards fatigue, severe headaches and migraines, difficulty breathing, deteriorating health, and increased thirst. \n\nHypothermia - \nThe body’s core temperature has fallen below safe levels and can no longer compensate leading towards severe fatigue, shivering, weakness of the limbs, deteriorating health, increased appetite, light sensitivity, hearing impairment and a risk of paradoxical undressing.\n\nMalnourished - \nWhen the body does not have enough nutrients to function normally. Symptoms can include weakness, deteriorating health, irritability, hearing and vision impairment.   \n\nSevere Injury - \nA general term used to describe when very serious trauma has been inflicted to the body. Often accompanied by vision loss. Requires immediate medical attention.\n\nUnconscious -\nWhen trauma is severe enough, an individual may experience a syncope, lose consciousness and become unable to respond to stimuli. \n\n

Journal_General_Nutrition_Content=We all lead busy lives, and sometimes making good nutrition choices can be a daunting challenge to say the least! \n\nThankfully, by using the NDR and HEI ratings assigned to most commercially available food and drinks, taking better care of yourself has never been easier. Just remember, the *higher* the score, the better the nutrition, and the better you'll feel. \n\nNutritional Density Rating (NDR)\nDevised by Empire Health Services to help people eat healthier, the Nutritional Density Rating (NDR) takes into consideration the food’s concentration of nutrients per 100kcal, the breadth and diversity of nutrients contained, and the nutritional bioavailability. The higher an NDR score, the better a food item is for your overall health. However, it is important to remember that no single food contains all the nutrients a single person needs, so along with eating high-scoring food, the second most important thing an individual can do is consume a wide variety of foods. Here’s to good eating and good health! \n\nHydration Efficacy Index (HEI)\nOriginally created by a team of nutritionists at the University of Jalan to compare the effects of beverage choice on hydration levels during long haul space flights, the Hydration Efficacy Index (HEI) has since been adapted by Empire Health Services as the standard measure by which various drink selections can be compared. By considering such factors as moisture retention, absorbency rates, osmolality, caloric count, and electrolyte levels (specifically sodium and potassium), a beverage can be graded using one standardized index. The higher the score, the more effective the beverage is at keeping the consumer hydrated for longer. Substances like caffeine and alcohol have the potential to decrease the index score by increasing the rate of water loss from the body. Standard filtration system water has a baseline score of 80. \n\nDietary Effects\nIn addition to the baseline scores, many foods and drinks have been additionally labeled with keywords to provide extra information about the potential effects that item will have on your health. Take a look at the list below for some of the most common effects and what they mean.\n\nHypertrophic - Provides additional blood flow and nutrients to key muscle groups to make them perform optimally.\n\nAtrophic - Restricts blood flow, negatively affecting the muscles, making tasks seem harder.\n\nEnergizing - Provides a boost to your energy levels, allowing you to be active for longer.\n\nFatiguing - Has a draining effect, causing lethargy and general sense of exhaustion.\n\nCognitive Boosting - Encourages brain function by allowing additional focus while performing complicated tasks.\n\nCognitive Impairing - Stymies brain activity making it difficult to focus for long durations. \n\nHypometabolic - Digests slowly, making you feel satisfied for longer.\n\nHypermetabolic - Digests quickly, increasing the likelihood you'll be hungry sooner.\n\nHydrating - Helps your body to better absorb water, allowing you to satisfy your thirst for longer.\n\nDehydrating - Causes your body to lose water, making you thirstier.\n\nHealing - Provides vital nutrients to help your body naturally repair itself. \n\nToxic - Contains elements that are detrimental to your health and can cause damage if consumed in large quantities. \n\nImmune Boosting - Helps your body stay healthy when exposed to harmful elements.\n\nImmune Suppressing - Weakens your body's ability to fight off harmful elements.\n\n\n

For the past year, the engineers at microTech have been working with industry-leading quantum drive manufacturers to allow our award winning StarMap app to seamlessly integrate with most consumer navigation software. This means you can now set quantum travel routes directly from inside the Starmap you are ready to use the StarMap to set quantum travel routes directly.  \n\nTo get started using these new features, follow the quickstart guide below.\n\nSafe Travels!\n\nThe StarMap App Dev Team\n\n_______________________________________\n\n\nSTARMAP QUANTUM TRAVEL QUICKSTART GUIDE\n\n1. From your cockpit chair, open up the StarMap app either by accessing it through your mobiGlas or your ship’s holo-display.\n\n2. Use the StarMap’s controls to pan and zoom around the map, till you see the destination you wish to travel to. (Remember, you may have to zoom in or out to locate a particular destination.)\n\n3. Click on the destination to see a route from your current location highlighted with a green scrolling dashed line. (If the route is inaccessible by a single quantum, it will appear a red static dashed line. If this is the case, you may have to travel to an accessible location first before traveling to your ultimate destination or refill your quantum fuel tank. For any additional issues, contact your quantum drive manufacturer.) \n\n4. Once you have your route selected, you can use the button on the lower left labeled “Set As Destination” to transfer these coordinates to your quantum drive’s navigational computer. The route will now be highlighted by green scrolling arrows.\n\n5. Close the StarMap and you are now set to begin quantum travel. After spooling your quantum drive in preparation, rotate your ship so that your prow is aimed at the diamond-shaped destination marker on your AR display to calibrate the navigational computer. Once spooled and calibrated, you will be able to initiate quantum to your set location. (Remember, you will not be able to quantum travel again till your drive’s cooldown period ends.)

System login indicates that Ward attempted another stress test at 1400 SET on day of accident, but didn’t ever turn the system off. Station systems went critical without the local failsafes and an explosion was inevitable.\n \nReviewing Ward’s personnel file indicated that he’d had addiction issues in the past and had even been suspended previously for negligence. Though supervisor reviews indicated he’d cleaned up since his return, our teams found evidence that he slipped back into bad habits shortly before the accident.\n \nTo perform our due diligence, we’ve exhausted other potential causes, but this one seems to be the most likely. As I mentioned, I’m still compiling my final report, which you will have when I make my presentation to the board.\n \n \nAva Skenning\nInvestigator\nCorporate Security - Covalex\n \n<i>The information contained in this message is confidential and only intended for the recipients.

I know the initial speculation was criminal sabotage, but based on this, it looked like worker negligence. Sad as it is to say.\n \nAnyway, I’ve attached a series of files to help illustrate my points and so you don’t have to sift through three million lines of data text.\n \n**/Excerpt_1 ATTACHED/**\n \nI’ve pulled together some sample readings from the Power Distribution logs. As you can see, over the past year, the station has been suffering from sporadic power drains. Maintenance reports theorized that there was a power drain somewhere, but to me, it looks like faulty switchers. These 2920’s were notorious for power flow issues.\n \n**/Excerpt_2 ATTACHED/**\n \nSo here is the initial stress test that Darnell Ward ran the day of the incident. Everything after <i>RUNPROTOCOL stresstest_v3.dnn</i> is the test taking effect. Everything looks good, right? Then, and I haven’t figured out why yet, but a few hours later (and in the middle of the stress test) he runs this <i>all_monitor_silence.dnn</i> protocol. Maybe he was trying to bring monitoring systems offline to see if they were causing the drain. I don’t really know. Anyway, it was a stupid move, because he basically removed his only way to see that the power plant was about to go critical. \n \nI’ll keep digging and keep you apprised.\n \nDennis

Use this process to ensure the Evidence Inventory System is functioning properly.  \n\nSpecific evidence pertaining to a particular case can only be retrieved with the proper legal authorization code. \n\nThe terminal’s Security Override can be used to end the verification process at any time. \n\nOnce a code has been used to begin the verification process it will become invalid. The system will generate a new code which will be sent to all authorized security personnel. To begin the verification process again, enter the new code.

LingFamily_Danger_001=Also, some of the family has run into trouble doing similar contracts recently. I would be extra careful. You know it's dangerous when cousin Maggi even says it. 
LingFamily_Danger_002=Also, a word of caution. I've got several reports highlighting this particular stretch as potentially dangerous. I don't think anything will happen, but just be ready in case trouble shows up. 
LingFamily_Danger_003=One more thing. I don't want to raise a false alarm, but there's a small chance that this contract may wind up being riskier than usual. Nothing concrete, but I've got a contact in Crusader Security who gave me a heads up. Should be fine, but be careful. 
LingFamily_Danger_004=And I probably don't have to say this, but Crusader's been having some security issues lately. It's not as safe as it once was, especially where you'll be going for this job. Be smart out there and stay safe. 
LingFamily_Family_001=My brother, Ricki, was supposed to handle this job but unfortunately his cooler blew. He's getting it fixed, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can step in. 
LingFamily_Family_002=My brother, Ricki, was supposed to handle this job but his power plant's been having issues. He's getting it fixed, it'd be great if you can take this one. 
LingFamily_Family_003=My brother, Ricki, was scheduled to handle this, but the quantum drive on his Lancer decided to stop working today. It's being repaired, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can handle it. 
LingFamily_Family_004=My brother, Ricki, is down for the count today owing to his life support system being on its last breath. He's getting it fixed, but in the meanwhile we're hoping you can fill in. 
LingFamily_Family_005=Ricki got caught up on the opposite side of Stanton doing a long haul, so we need someone else to handle this job. 
LingFamily_Family_006=I originally had Ricki slated for this, but a leaky fuel line means he's not going to get back in time. Hopefully, you're available. 
LingFamily_Family_007=Fabian, my cousin, commed in sick again. Guess his suit actuator failed while he was doing a drop on Yela and he caught a cold. So we need someone to pick up the slack today. 
LingFamily_Family_008=Got a last minute comm from my cousin Fabian that he isn't feeling well again. Seems he picked up a stomach bug from a bad burrito and can't fly. Would be great if you could cover for him. 
LingFamily_Family_009=Hoping that you'll be able to fill in for my cousin Fabian. Not sure exactly what happened, but seems like his arm is on the fritz and he can't fly till he sees a cybernetician. You'll definitely be helping us out if you're available. 
LingFamily_Family_010=You ever hear of Dolphin Tongue? Well, my cousin Fabian woke up with it. Half his face is swollen to the size of burstmelon. Would you be free to take over for him today? 
LingFamily_Family_011=My cousin Maggi had some trouble with the Nine Tails and is filing a report with Crusader right now. Of course, that could wind up taking all afternoon so I need someone to handle this job for her. 
LingFamily_Family_012=I thought that my cousin Maggi was going to be able to do this one, but she has to chase down a missing order. Hoping that it wasn't stolen. Either way, she's going to be tied up for a while. 
LingFamily_Family_013=Fabian caught a stomach bug and now the rest of the family seems to have got it. To be honest, I'm not feeling so great, but I'm hanging in for now. Since they're all busy making their own "deliveries" until the medicine kicks in, I was thinking you might be able to take care of this job. 
LingFamily_Family_014=A bunch of the family headed over to New Babbage for the day to celebrate another cousin's birthday. And guess who didn't get to go? Anyway, still plenty of work around here that needs doing.

LingFamily_Reaction_BadStreak_001=After that last contract, how many screw ups was that? You know what? I don't want to scold you like you're some kid. I'm just gonna say do better and leave it at that. 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadStreak_002=Seems like you've been having a really hard time getting through these contracts. Last few jobs we've thrown you're way haven't exactly gone as planned. We're not a big company so these setbacks really hurt our bottom line. You're just going to have to do better, okay? Having said that... 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadToGood_001=Guess you're a diamond in the rough, after all. Had a bet going with my sister Linda that you would screw up that last contract. Now I have to make her dinner, but hey, it's better than having to clean up your mess again. Anyway... 
LingFamily_Reaction_BadToGood_002=Way to turn it around. I was getting worried about you, but that last contract showed you got potential. We'll have to see if you can keep it up... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Bad_001=Rough time on that last contract, huh? It happens. Important thing is not focus on it too much, and get back out there - 
LingFamily_Reaction_Bad_002=Hard to say exactly where you went wrong on that last contract, but it wasn't pretty. Let's do better this time, Okay? 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodStreak_001=Got to say, you've really been killing it out there. Even Davi's been impressed and he's been doing this for decades. Anyway... 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodStreak_002=I'm starting to think we got pretty lucky finding you. You've been giving Ling Family Hauling a good name out there with all the recent work you've been doing for us. Speaking of... 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodToBad_001=That last contract got away from you or what? Don't worry though. Screwing up every once in a while is what being part of the Ling Family is all about. (Don't tell them I said that.) 
LingFamily_Reaction_GoodToBad_002=Tough break on that last job. Can't be perfect all the time, I guess. Unless your my sister Linda. But let's not talk about her right now... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Good_001=You did good on that last contract. Nice stuff. 
LingFamily_Reaction_Good_002=Real quick, wanted to mention the last contract you did. Saw that it went well. Good work. That said... 
LingFamily_Reaction_LastWarning_001=So far, I think as a whole, Ling Family Hauling has been more than fair with you. But this contract is the end. Either you get it right, or we're done working with you. That simple. That said... 
LingFamily_Reaction_LastWarning_002=Listen, this contract here? This is your last chance. We can't afford to risk any more business on you unless you find a way to turn things around. That said... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Renew_001=Okay. So, I'm gonna tell you straight. If it had been up to me, we would have burned your contact, but dad seems to think you deserve another chance, so here we are... 
LingFamily_Reaction_Renew_002=Here's what's happening. We had a family meeting and decided that maybe you deserve another chance. I hope you make the most of it. That said... 
LingFamily_Timed_001=Unfortunately, we're on a bit of a tight schedule with this one. Need it taken care of ASAP. 
LingFamily_Timed_002=Be sure to keep in mind that this job has a firm deadline. Not much wiggle room. 
LingFamily_Timed_003=Make sure to keep an eye on clock when you're out there. Don't want you missing the deadline. 
LingFamily_Timed_004=Make sure to be mindful of the time while you're working. Our business depends on us being punctual. 
LingFamily_UGF_collect_desc_001=Hey,\n\nWe need you to grab a delivery for us over at ~mission(Location|Address) and then take it to ~mission(Destination|Address).\n\nI was originally going to send my brother Ricki to handle this, but he said the area’s too dangerous. Guess there’s been a bunch of security warnings around there, but as long as you’re careful and bring some guns or whatever, I’m sure you’ll be fine. You probably won’t even run into anything. \n\nThanks, \nConni Ling\nShipment Coordinator\nLing Family Hauling\n

LingFamily_delivery_desc_0004=Hello,\n\nConni normally does these so you'll have to bear with me. Still trying to wrap my head around the system she set up.

She's so good at all this stuff. \n\nAnyway, if I'm reading the invoice correctly, the shipment is at ~mission(Location|Address) and needs to be hauled over to ~mission(Destination|Address).

MercenaryGuild_RepUI_Description=As Humanity entered its first interspecies war against the Tevarin in 2541, space travel became a lot more dangerous and private security firms found themselves providing services that had formally be regulated to more official channels. In order to navigate these uncharted waters, and better establish the role of modern mercenaries, some of the largest firms banded together to form the first iteration of the Mercenary Guild.

MilesEckhart_IntroCommLawful_1,P=Hey, how are you? Miles Eckhart, Eckhart Security. A friend over at Crusader Security said you've building quite a rep. I run a modest security outfit and am always on the lookout for capable people who don't rattle. If you're interested in picking up some extra work, we should talk. I'll send my details.
MilesEckhart_IntroInPersonLawful_1,P=Hey there, sport. Grab a seat. Sorry for the locale, don't look like much but the homemade stuff has some kick. Anyway, I've been hearing good things about you. Real stand-up sort. Just the type of people I like to know. As I mentioned, I run a small security outfit, we handle all sorts of ops, so I'm always on the lookout for people who know how to handle themselves in a scrap.
MilesEckhart_LawfulKillCaptorsattackersWhilstKeepingHostagesattackedAlive_2,P=We've just been hired to retrieve another poor bastard who's been abducted. Same drill as before, keep the hostage alive, whatever happens to the captors happens.
MilesEckhart_LawfulKillCriminal_2,P=Another bounty came over the spec if you're interested. Have a look.
MilesEckhart_LawfulKillCriminal_4,P=This one came straight from the Guild. It's a high value, high risk target. Watch yourself with this one.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksSurroundedByPirates_1,P=A contract just came through to go look into several ship wrecks in the area. One problem. The people responsible for making the wrecks are still in the area and they might take issue with you, so expect a fight.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksSurroundedByPirates_3,P=High risk retrieval just came in. Check out out the details and see if you're interested, otherwise I'll pass it along.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksToInvestigate_1,P=Been getting a lot of requests to chase down ship wrecks. Usually they're a sleepwalk, but they can get dicey real quick depending on which area they're sending you to. I'll send you the request from the insurance company, just follow their instructions and collect your creds.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksToInvestigate_3,P=Guess some idiot pilot went and got themself killed, so we've got another contract to find the wreck.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustDeliverOnemultiplePackageInAGivenTime_2,P=Just got pinged from another delivery. It's time sensitive so don't take the gig if you can't make the deadline.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustDeliverOnemultiplePackages_2,P=Need another delivery if you got the time.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustDropOffAndPickUpItems_1,P=This one's gonna be a hand-off. Client's a bit worried about the folks on the other side of the deal, so figured a little muscle to handle the trade would be smart. It'll be on you to make sure the transfer runs smooth as ice.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipFromAToB_1,P=An escort job just tumbled free and wondered if you might be available. Should be easy money, but keep your eyes open.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipFromAToB_2,P=Need a babysitter for a ship run. Take a look and see if you're interested.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipOnASeriesOfLocations_1,P=It's a basic escort mission, the client's got a handful of stops they need to make. You follow and keep them out of trouble. Not too tough, right?
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareForAssaultLocationsMustBeVagueStationCommArrayServiceStationOutpost_1,P=We've gotten word that an assault's building against some honest-to-god law-abiding folks and they need some help. Pay's not great, but hey, it's not always about the money, right? I'm kidding.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareToAttackLocationsMustBeVagueStationServiceStationAsteroidField_1,P=We've got a target that we need to take down. I've coordinated with local law and bounty hunters so it's totally above board. Anyway, you aren't going to be able to take them in a stand up fight, so you'll need to trap them.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareToAttackLocationsMustBeVagueStationServiceStationAsteroidField_2,P=Got another scumbag who's ready for the swift hand of justice... and worth a sizeable bounty. Up for another ambush?
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustHelpAShipKillOtherShipsWhilstKeepingTheEscortedShipAlive_1,P=Here's the deal, I've managed to secure a retainer for local law enforcement agencies. I just got word that they're moving on some criminal elements and want some backup.
MilesEckhart_LawfulPlayersMustTakeAnNpcAboardAndDeliverHimToALocationSafely_2,P=Another chaffeur job just came across the spec. Have a look and see if you're interested.
MilesEckhart_LawfulRecoverStolenCargoGuardedByCriminals_2,P=Law enforcement and Advocacy have been cracking down on cargo theft across the systems and are paying operators for the safe retrieval of stolen cargo. Anyway, I put the squeeze on a couple local scumbags and got a line on some hot merch in the area.
MilesEckhart_LawfulSearchAWreckForCorpseOrEvidence_1,P=This job's a retrieval op. Need to collect a special bit of- let's say "salvage." I'm gonna give you the honor of going to the wreck, and finding it.
MilesEckhart_MissionFail_6,P=The whole thing's gone div and I'm left holding the stick. Hope you're proud of yourself. 
MilesEckhart_OncePlayerSits_1,P=So... don't look like much, do ya? Just kidding. So here's my boilerplate pitch, Eckhart Security handles escorts, VIP protection, hostile extractions and even some militia work when they can afford us. Anyway, a job came in late last night. Some idiot hauler thought it'd be a good idea to shave some flight time by cutting through low-sec space and got his crew vented. Company needs to retrieve the ship's blackbox to claim insurance on the lost cargo. Should be a romper job: get in, get out, but all my people are tied up with bigger ops, so I figured I could use this as a chance to make a new friend. I'll send the details, look them over on your own time and if you're interested, hit me back.
MilesEckhart_RepUI_Association=Eckhart Security
MilesEckhart_RepUI_Biography=After leaving the Army, Miles Eckhart missed the excitement of his former life and decided to try mercenary work.

MilesEckhart_RevisitYoureCurrentlyOnAMission_2,P=You got the details, so get moving.
MilesEckhart_SitsInTheCornerOfTheDarkBarHePerksUpWhenHeSeesYou_1,P=Hey! Over here. How you been? Grab a seat. Come on. Get in here....
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulAtPrisonHard_2,P=Got a dangerous one for you. Probably the less I talk about it the better.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulAtSecurityPost_1,P=Seems one of our clients has been picked up by some two-bit security outfit who fancy themselves real do-gooders. Anyway, our enterprise doesn't benefit with this client incarcerated, so I need you to get them out.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulAtSecurityPost_3,P=I swear, I don't know how some of these idiots have stayed alive long enough to make enough money to keep us on retainer. Anyway, we've got another client cooling their heels in a low-sec clink. You free to boost them?
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulKillInnocentOrRivalCriminal_3,P=Hey killer, feel like earning some extra creds? Got another target that's living on borrowed breath.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksSurroundedByPirates_2,P=Since they're in the stealing mood, I figure no one will mind if we help ourselves. If they do, I trust you'll handle them.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersAreGivenTheLocationOfSeveralWrecksToInvestigate_1,P=Clients are looking for someone to track down some ships they lost. I don't know if they're trying to retrieve evidence before the law does or what. To be honest, I didn't ask.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDeliverOnemultiplePackageInAGivenTime_1,P=Contact of mine just hit me up. He's got some product he needs moved quick and quiet. I'm talking invisible here, no scans, no checkpoints. You get pinched with this, you're on your own.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDeliverOnemultiplePackages_2,P=Need some low profile product that needs to be moved. I'd skirt any heavy security scans if you get my meaning.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDropOffABomb_2,P=Exciting news, slick. Something needs blowing up, and you get to be the lucky one to do it. 
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustDropOffAndPickUpItems_2,P=So one of my shakier clients is a little nervous and wants us to handle a hand-off. You give 'em ours. We take theirs. And if they try anything... well, you take care of it.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipFromAToB_2,P=You free for another protection op? Got a client who needs a heavy hitter on their wing.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustEscortAShipOnASeriesOfLocations_2,P=You got time for an escort op? It's another staggered one so you'll hit multiple spots. Have a look.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustFindOnemultipleItemsByScavengingOrKillingAndLootingNoHelpIsGivenFindingTheItems_1,P=Got a retrieval op for you. Now, you should know that the owners of the items in question are going to be resistent to the idea of giving up their cargo. I trust you'll be able to change their mind.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareForAssaultLocationsMustBeVagueStationCommArrayServiceStationOutpost_2,P=So one of my more - lets say verbal - clients has apparently pissed off the wrong people. Needs some protection and defenses laid down to help in case they retaliate. Hoping you could handle it.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustGoToALocationAndPrepareToAttackLocationsMustBeVagueStationServiceStationAsteroidField_2,P=Got another name that needs to be marked off. I've worked out the time and place for the ambush, just need a trigger to do the deed.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustHelpAShipKillOtherShipsWhilstKeepingTheEscortedShipAlive_2,P=It's another muscle job, back up the client and shoot up whoever they want shot up.
MilesEckhart_UnlawfulPlayersMustTakeAnNpcAboardAndDeliverHimToALocationSafely_2,P=Got another passenger that's looking for low profile transport.

NB_IceSculpture_Name=Sublimate
NB_Plant_Desc_001=Created to be able to survive in near no-light conditions. The resulting altered chlorophyll structure gives the plant its dark coloring and unique woven-like texture. It is hoped that this research will help populate worlds with long night cycles.
NB_Plant_Desc_002=Related to the colocasia, this plant features enormous broad leaves that are pliable and water resistant making it an ideal plastic substitute on remote worlds. Additionally, its sprawling root structure is an edible starch when cooked.
NB_Plant_Desc_003=Derived from a Xi'an desert plant, the many ridges along its trunk are ideal for capturing early morning dew in arid climates. The internal storage cells can collect up to a gallon of drinking water a day in the right conditions.
NB_Plant_Desc_004=The unique fractal structure of the violet curcuma's leaves help convert shorter light-waves into a frequency more suitable for photosynthesis. This allows it to flourish in systems where stars are in the later stages of their life and not producing ideal growth light. Its rhizomes also have culinary and medical uses.
NB_Plant_Desc_005=The unique leaves of this palm variant show a huge leap in bio-engineering possibilities thanks to their meticulously designed aerodynamic structure that allows the plant to endure hurricane strength winds.
NB_Plant_Desc_006=This carnivorous plant catches insects with the sticky resin it secretes, allowing it to not only act as an exterminator for unwanted pests, but also survive in severely nitrogen depleted soil.
NB_Plant_Desc_007=The closely woven structure of the Haldor lily provides it with extreme strength and durability. Suitable for planets plagued with torrential storms or swarming insects, this lily is one of the hardier plants ever fabricated.
NB_Plant_Desc_008=With a strong, thin trunk, the sky palm was designed to grow on worlds with thicker atmospheres where it would be able to collect more of the available sunlight at high elevations.
NB_Plant_Desc_009=The thick trunk of this barrel palm tree is able to hold considerable moisture drawn in from the soil offering a possible water conservation solution to settlers living in arid climates.
NB_Plant_Desc_010=The weaver palm was designed to produce a renewable, strong, lightweight, and flexible material that would serve a variety of purposes for settlers of a new world. Low maintenance and hardy, the plant can grow successfully in a variety of conditions.
NB_Plant_Desc_011=The designers of this plant wanted to protect it from as many herbivore tactics as possible to ensure that its harvest could reach full maturity undisturbed while leaving it non-toxic. The spikes along the trunk makes climbing difficult, the bark appears diseased and dead, and the leaves contain barbed alkaloids that cause extreme pain with skin contact. DO NOT TOUCH.
NB_Plant_Desc_012=Designed to be grown in wet soil and marshland, the dracaena pura acts as a natural aquifer, cleaning water as it passes through its root system. The height of the plant helps it distribute the pollutants it collects to a lower toxicity level to which it can successfully cope.
NB_Plant_Desc_013=When worlds are first being settled, high winds can be a serious issue until enough plant life can take hold. The grand flabellum with its wide leaf structure and deep root system act as erosion breaks helping to protect more delicate plants and structures.
NB_Plant_Desc_014=The leaves of this plant were crafted by engineers to excrete an oil that serves as a natural insect repellent. It is hoped that by planting it in symbiosis with other more valuable crops that it can serve as a deterrent to harmful pests.
NB_Plant_Desc_015=Created to help alleviate symptoms caused by other airborne allergens, the pollen from the flight-of-fancy's bright flowers is a natural antihistamine and is capable of blocking histamine receptors. As a bonus, its large broad leaves provide ample shade making them ideal to plant near habitat areas.

Orison_DiscoverySpot_001_desc=To achieve the perfect level of atmospheric comfort, the vibrant city of Orison carefully maintains its precise orbital height above the gas giant Crusader through controlled firing of the Seraph-class thrusters situated below each platform. Precisely timed to prevent shearing and destabilization of the connected network of struts, each thruster is activated for a short burst allowing Orison to stay firmly in place. Crusader locals often describe the gentle vibrations that accompany the periodic adjustments as "Orison’s free massage." Be sure to hold on and enjoy!
Orison_DiscoverySpot_001_title=How Does Orison Stay in the Clouds?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_002_desc=Though it’s common knowledge that Crusader Industries works with the Navy on a handful of contracts, it’s less well known that Providence Platform was originally constructed as a Naval drydock in 2855 to take advantage of the lower gravity and breathable atmosphere found here. It was these same reasons that made the world such a great choice to be Crusader’s new headquarters. When the company purchased Stanton II in 2865, Providence Platform underwent major renovations to transform it into the cutting edge manufacturing center that it is today. Of course, while it may not be an official Navy site any longer, Crusader is proud to carry on the tradition of working to help people across the empire. 
Orison_DiscoverySpot_002_title=Was Providence Platform Built by the Navy?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_003_desc=While being a floating city may make for absolutely stunning vistas, it can be a bit tricky getting from platform to platform. No walking to work here! For Crusader employees and visitors alike the solution is Orison Skyway Shuttle Service. Providing connections to all major platforms, Crusader offers free and convenient transit shuttles made right here in Orison. These recently redesigned shuttles feature signature crystal canopies that provide amazing views of the city as you travel, helping to make getting there half the fun.
Orison_DiscoverySpot_003_title=What's the Best Way to Visit Other Platforms?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_004_desc=Cutting a stark contrast against the vibrant sky, the sweeping lines of Orison’s signature stormwal sculpture captures the grace and beauty of the gentle creatures it portrays. Formally titled "Until Again,"artist Bipasha Zhu says that she was inspired by the city’s harmony and weightless strength. To better understand her bashful subjects, Bipasha spent a week living in a cloud submersible studying the stormwals up close. Talk about taking your art to new depths! Art aficionados and visitors to Orison who want to get their own firsthand stormwal encounter should jump on board the next Orison Discovery Tour shuttle.
Orison_DiscoverySpot_004_title=What's the Story Behind Orison's Stormwal?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_005_desc=Orison is a city unlike any other and when it came to designing its gardens, only the perfect tree would do. Something that was well adapted to high winds and low humidity, that could self-pollinate, and most importantly, was beautiful. So which tree won? None of them. After a lot of searching, Crusader’s gardeners would have to create the perfect tree themselves. A cross-combination of flowering dogwoods and taverbark pines, the Hosanna tree features strong roots, flexible branches, delicately scented pink flowers, and the ability to make just about any walk in the park a memorable one. 
Orison_DiscoverySpot_005_title=Why are Orison's Trees so Special?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_006_desc=The name Crusader Industries actually has two meanings. First, it represents a commitment to stay on the forefront of ship manufacturing ideas. Though the company got its start building reliable planetary shuttles. The teams of engineers constantly looked to push the commercial ship market. Whether it was by developing a new feature of engineering or simply looking to fulfill a new area of public demand. Secondly, the name references the company's commitment to vigorously advocate for what is morally right across the Empire. Company founder August Dunlow has made giving back a cornerstone of the company ever since its inception in 2799. That means when you support Crusader Industries, you're supporting a company dedicated to improving the empire for all.
Orison_DiscoverySpot_006_title=What's the Meaning Behind Crusaders' Name?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_007_desc=More than just the name of a spaceport, Crusader Industries founder August Dunlow led a memorable and incredible life. Born on Angeli in the Croshaw system, he was orphaned in the aftermath of the bloody Khanos Stadium coup that ousted Imperator Messer X. Saved from the streets by a local charity, Dunlow was able to pursue his academics while volunteering in his spare time. Upon graduating from University of Angeli, he became a prominent anti-Messer activist and civil rights advocate pushing for government reform. August founded Crusader Industries in 2799 on the principle that a business truly thrives when it gives back to society. Today you stand among these majestic clouds thanks to his incredible vision that a company can be both financially profitable and a force for good.
Orison_DiscoverySpot_007_title=Who was August Dunlow?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_008_desc=Keeping Orison supplied and the shipyards stocked is an incredible operation in and of itself. On a normal day, over a quarter of a million SCU worth of cargo is moved between manufacturing platforms, shipyards, and support facilities with the help of Crusader’s Atlas-class cargo ferries. Specifically designed with an open top to expedite the loading and unloading of cargo, these barges run all day long and are the lifeblood of production on Orison. Over 5,000 Crusader employees focus solely on the logistics that keep these barges full and flying to their next drop point. This beautiful ballet of people, ships, and cargo ensures that everything in Orison is running as effectively and efficiently as possible.
Orison_DiscoverySpot_008_title=Why does Orison have so many Transport Ships?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_009_desc=It takes a special kind of person to join the Crusader Industries family. Not only do employees have to be highly qualified and skilled, but most importantly, they have to be passionate about what they do. CEO Kelly Caplan always says "Crusader makes the best ships because we have the best employees"and it’s true! Just look at the 'Crusader Cares' charity initiative spearheaded by the generous workers here at Orison which has made a difference in the lives of people all over. Seems like they’re trying to make the rest of the empire as happy as they are!
Orison_DiscoverySpot_009_title=Who are the People Working for Crusader?
Orison_DiscoverySpot_010_desc=Believe it or not, building large spaceships is hard! If you attempted to build them in traditional factories on a planet with Earth-like gravity, you’d be faced with a massive amount of challenges just to  arrange the ship’s pieces into place and keep them from collapsing during construction. Sometimes these larger ships can’t even leave the atmosphere after they’re done which is why most larger ships are finished in space. But space has its own set of issues, sure, you don’t have to worry about weight, but all your engineers and mechanics have to work in spacesuits which is potentially more dangerous. On Crusader, our employees get the best of both techniques. Lower gravity and they can work in-atmosphere. No wonder people love working here!
