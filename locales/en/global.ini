item_Desc10mm_pistol_ballistic=Traditional gun powder based ammunition that fires slugs from a shell, detonated by a firing pin. The slug trails down a barrel to help guide its trajectory.
item_Desc10mm_rifle_laser=The Plasma Coil - Field Fusion tangles 2 streams of plasma energy into a dense coil before unraveling it, allowing it to shoot far distances with intense energy. Unfortunately this process creates a lot of sound for the user, even though many muffle mechanics are usually built within the chamber of weapons that use this type of plasma energy.
item_Desc12g_electric=Pulse Slug 10 is a small focused energy that molds into the shape of a small ball of energy. The projectile shocks biotics and disrupts electronics. It can be clustered or shot in single form, but the chaotic nature of how the slugs are created from the energy can cause chaotic formations in its execution, much like a bubble gun.
item_Desc20mm_Tungsten=<-=MISSING=->
item_Desc25mm_special_ballistic=The mX-Shatter Rocket is a rocket that scatters small explosives on impact or after a very brief period of time. Whenever the rocket shoots out the smaller explosives fire off in random directions, excellent for clearing out areas. Every shatter rocket has a cluster of about 20 small explosives that aren't as powerful as frag grenades on their own, but combined are about the same as a frag grenade.
item_Desc25mm_special_ballistic_fragment=The mX-Shatter Rocket is a rocket that scatters small explosives on impact or after a very brief period of time. Whenever the rocket shoots out the smaller explosives fire off in random directions, excellent for clearing out areas. Every shatter rocket has a cluster of about 20 small explosives that aren't as powerful as frag grenades on their own, but combined are about the same as a frag grenade.
item_Desc2ghz_microwave_energy=Uranium Core ammunition stabilizes uranium for portable weapon usage in small doses. Each 'magazine' contains a set charge of power with the uranium and can be safely disposed of/stored after use. When used, it controls an intense amount of radioactive energy from whatever method the radiation is disposed. The condensed radiation is powerful enough to get through most armor types except Heavy/TITAN armor.
item_Desc300i-C_LoadoutKit=Increase your killer instinct with the 300i-C package. Two S3 Klaus & Werner laser repeaters replace the standard Behring ballistic repeaters, while upgrades to the power plant (Civilian, Grade B), shield (Industrial, Grade B), and cooler (Industrial, Grade B) push performance further.  \n 
item_Desc300i-G_LoadoutKit=Stay frosty with the 300i-G package. Gimbals give the 300i-G a wider range of motion for its three S2 Klaus & Werner laser repeaters to make aiming even easier. \n 
item_Desc300i-T_LoadoutKit=Extend your adventure with the 300i-T package that features an upgraded power plant (Civilian, Grade B), cooler (Competition, Grade B), and quantum drive (Civilian, Grade B) to provide the extra performance needed to send you faster and further into the unknown. Dual S3 Associated Science & Development distortion repeaters can subdue aggressors long enough for an swift escape. \n        
item_Desc300i_HAPR_VP_RMI_S3_Q2=The Hammer Propulsion HE5.3 features a high output, fuel efficient design. Its thrust output and low fuel consumption make it ideal for long hauls though it has been reported to be somewhat of a missile magnet on occasions where owners have been subject to pirate activity.
item_Desc315p-GT_LoadoutKit=The 315p-GT package helps turn any outing into an adventure thanks to its upgraded cooler (Stealth, Grade B) and quantum drive (Industrial, Grade B). The complement of two gimbaled S2 Associated Science & Development distortion repeaters ensure that you can peacefully resolve almost any altercation, but if aggression is your only option, the GT replaces the standard Firestorm Kinetics Tempest missiles with Talon Dominators. \n   
item_Desc315p-XC_LoadoutKit=Built to make an entrance and an impact, the 315p-XC package pairs two S3 Gallenson Tactical Systems ballistic gatling guns with the standard tractor beam. An improved power plant (Stealth, Grade B), shield (Stealth, Grade B), cooler (Stealth, Grade B), and quantum drive (Military, Grade B) provide the power and protection needed to survive and thrive in a skirmish.\n  
item_Desc325a-CC_LoadoutKit=Get up close and personal with the 325a-CC. Designed to engage and dominate at short-range, this package features one S4 Preacher Armament distortion scattergun and two S3 Hurston Dynamics laser scatterguns. The CC also changes the component suite to a power plant (Military, Grade B), shield (Military, Grade B), cooler (Competition, Grade B), and quantum drive (Civilian, Grade C).
item_Desc325a-CI_LoadoutKit=Intercept or eradicate? The choice is yours with the 325a-CI package. Youâll have options to subdue your opponents with an imposing S4 Apocalypse Arms gatling gun, two S3 Associated Science & Development distortion repeaters, and two S3 FireStorm Kinetics Arrestor missiles. Boosted performance comes courtesy of an enhanced power plant (Military, Grade B), shield (Military, Grade B), cooler (Competition, Grade B), and quantum drive (Competition, Grade B).\n     
item_Desc325a-LC_LoadoutKit=One S4 and two S3 A&R Co. laser cannons make the 325a-LC package deadly from a distance. To complement this firepower, the LC comes with an upgraded power plant (Military, Grade B) and cooler (Military, Grade B).\n 
item_Desc325a-XC_LoadoutKit=The 325a-XC package keeps you on the offensive with ten missiles, plus one S4 Apocalypse Arms and two S3 Gallenson Tactical Systems ballistic gatling guns. The XC also overhauls the component suite to contain a power plant (Military, Grade B), shield (Military, Grade B), cooler (Military, Grade B), and quantum drive (Civilian, Grade C). All combined, the XC makes quick work of aggressors foolish enough to try their luck.    \n  
item_Desc325a_HAPR_VP_RMI_S3_Q2=The Hammer Propulsion HE5.3 features a high output, fuel efficient design. Its thrust output and low fuel consumption make it ideal for long hauls though it has been reported to be somewhat of a missile magnet on occasions where owners have been subject to pirate activity.
item_Desc350r-SP_LoadoutKit=Power and performance purr through every inch of the 350r-SP package. It features across the board upgrades to the components, with the power plant, shield, cooler, and quantum drive all rated as Competition class, Grade B. The SP also includes two S3 Associated Science & Development distortion repeaters that can pacify aggressors for an effective getaway.\n 
item_Desc350r-S_LoadoutKit=Kick into top gear with the 350r-S package that features a boosted power plant (Competition, Grade B), cooler (Competition, Grade B), and quantum drive (Competition, Grade C). Plus, two Associated Science & Development S3 distortion repeaters provide a non-lethal alternative to the standard Behring laser cannon.
item_Desc350r_HAPR_VP_ESI_S3_Q2=The Hammer Propulsion Twin HM4.3 is notable for the fact that it utilizes 2 high-performance TR3 thrusters in a small package. An unusual application, the original design was a joint collaboration between Hammer Propulsion and the Origin Jumpworks racing team. With the additional thrust provided by a second thruster the Twin HM4.3 is ideal for applications where speed is the goal. Speed comes at a cost, however; this configuration has a thirst for fuel that rivals much larger single thruster systems, and with all of its available space being taken up by the thruster internals not much space is left for durability reinforcement. This makes the HM4.3 ideal for most racing pilots, but less suitable for combat-oriented missions.
item_Desc400i_Paint_2952Fortuna_Green_Grey=Make luck your co-pilot. Boldly set your sights on the stars and adventure forth in style with the Fortuna livery. This Stella Fortuna themed paint scheme is primarily green with grey accents.

item_Desc6mm_pistol_laser=Pulse Slug 10 is a small focused energy that molds into the shape of a small ball of energy. The projectile shocks biotics and disrupts electronics. It can be clustered or shot in single form, but the chaotic nature of how the slugs are created from the energy can cause chaotic formations in its execution, much like a bubble gun.

Once it has safely returned to Mars, the blend is aged for several more years to ensure it has the distinct smooth and mellow profile Radegast is known for. The result is a 40-year-old dram that embraces the adventurous flavor profiles of Angeli with the traditional personality of a Martian whiskey; a drink worthy of coming home for.
