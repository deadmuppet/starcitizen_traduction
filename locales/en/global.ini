Client paid out serious creds, so I can't just let it drift.\n\nWant you to get aboard the October Rising, get my shit, and get out. \n\nWord is that security are still on site so you might wanna pull together a crew if you got 'em. If you're feeling really highline, shut down the nearest comm array to cover your tracks. Point is, they probably won't react well to you showing up, but just remember they aren't the priority.\n\nDrop the package off at the clinic on Grim HEX and we'll transfer the creds.

assassin_danger_0001=If even half the rumors about them are true, you're going to want to take them out long before they see you coming.Â 
assassin_danger_0002=Apparently, this is supposed to be one of the more dangerous hitters in the sector. Do not make the mistake of underestimating them.Â 
assassin_danger_0003=Make sure to bring your full arsenal when you go hunting. Something tells me you might need it to take them down.Â 
assassin_danger_0004=Word of warning, no way someone like ~mission(TargetName|Last) is going down easy. You want to take them out? Do it hard and fast.Â 
assassin_danger_0005=While you should be careful, cause you never know - my guess is that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is gonna drop easy. Poor sod chooses to fly solo and hardly ever bothers with anything more than a few escorts.Â 
assassin_danger_0006=As for gearing up for this little job, you shouldn't need anything out of the ordinary. ~mission(TargetName|Last) prefers to fly alone. I mean, for a real special occasion they might travel with a friend or two, but I'd be surprised.Â Â 
assassin_danger_0007=Apparently, there's a good chance this scav's not gonna be traveling alone either. Seems that their little multicrew ship hardly ever flies without at least one or two friends along for the trip.Â Â 
assassin_danger_0008=Word is that the small multicrew ship ~mission(TargetName|Last) captains is being guarded by a few hired escorts. Can't say for sure if it's true, but good to be careful just in case.Â Â 
assassin_danger_0009=Rumor has it that ~mission(TargetName|Last) typically travels with a full escort so be ready to hit hard. Even if you do get lucky and catch them alone, you'll still have their ship to deal with and supposedly they captain a bit of a beast.Â 
assassin_danger_0010=Make sure to bring your full arsenal when you go hunting. Since ~mission(TargetName|Last) usually captains a bigger multicrew ship and springs the extra credits for escort, something tells me you might need the extra firepower.Â 
assassin_desc=~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDescription)

assassin_desc_0002=Got a mess that needs cleaning up. Paying solid credits for it too. The mess goes by the name of ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Danger) \n\nBuddy of mine saw them around ~mission(Location), but the rest is up to you. ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_0003=There's a price on ~mission(TargetName)'s head. ~mission(MultiPlayer)Credits go to whoever bags the bastard first. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) I'd recommend starting at ~mission(Location) but hey, don't let me tell you how to do your job. ~mission(Danger)
assassin_desc_0004=Guess who just got themselves placed onto the 'no-breathe-list'? Some dragger named ~mission(TargetName). Yeah, I never heard of them either, but better them than us, right? \n\n~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer)Word is they've been haunting ~mission(Location) lately, so you'll probably want to start there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)Good luck.
assassin_desc_0005=I don't know what ~mission(TargetName) did, but they sure pissed off the wrong people. Credits go to whoever can give them a last lesson in manners straight through the head. ~mission(Danger) \n\nThere isn't much to go on, just some scattered sightings around ~mission(Location), so maybe start there. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)~mission(MultiPlayer)One last thing, the client wants you to say '~mission(Phrase).' when the trigger's pulled. Don't ask. Just do it. 
assassin_desc_0006=~mission(TargetName) is breathing borrowed air. Time's come to punch their ticket for good. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) I can give you ~mission(Location) but you have to provide your own transport and clean weapons. ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer)
assassin_desc_0007=You know how they say the good die young? It's definitely true in this case. A hit's been put out on ~mission(TargetName), a local security thug that's hellbent on being a hero. ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer)
assassin_desc_0008=Why don't these security assholes ever learn to mind their own damn business? It's like they want to get murdered. Especially this one. Name's ~mission(TargetName). Been stirring up huge trouble lately, but you're gonna put a permanent end to that.\n\n~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed) ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationDanger) Knowing these security types, don't be surprised if they call for back up.
assassin_desc_0009=About time someone put ~mission(TargetName) in their place. This security hackjob's been taking bribes to look the other way, but the greedy little idiot decided to raise the rates. Big mistake! \n\nNow instead of those credits going to pay the smug bastard off, they're being used to pay you to murder their ass. That's some poetic justice right there. ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_0010=This bounty hunter by the name of ~mission(TargetName) made the mistake of messing with the wrong crew. They're looking to even the score and are offering pretty decent creds to whoever does the deed. ~mission(Danger) ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_0011=I love it. This is one of those classic 'the hunter has become the hunted' scenarios you always see on the spec.Â \n\nA big bounty's been placed on the head of bounty hunter ~mission(TargetName). ~mission(Danger) It'll be interesting to see how they like it when they tables are turned. ~mission(MultiPlayer) ~mission(Contractor|AssassinationTimed)
assassin_desc_easy=~mission(Contractor|AssassinationEasyDescription)
assassin_desc_first=Listen, I know you don't know me, but that's kinda the point of this little experiment. We're just two complete strangers helping each other out.Â \n\nHere's how this works - I give you a name. ~mission(TargetName), for example. Then I'll tell you a place: ~mission(Location). Now, if by some complete and utter coincidence, they wind up shot to death a little while later, a bunch of credits will mystically appear in your account. Long story short, ~mission(TargetName|NickOrFirst) has some bad luck, you have some good luck. Everybody's happy.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of other people eager for the help of a dependable stranger and if you do a good job here, I'll make sure they know you're the stranger to talk to.\n\nGood luck out there.

bitzeros_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=Hey,\n\nSome interesting intel just spun into our orbit. Seems ~mission(location|address) got some confidential materials delivered to them on the sly. Anything theyâre going those lengths to hideâs got to be worth something, right? Thatâs why weâre shelling out primo creds to anyone willing to breach the facility, snag the confidential materials, and drop them off at ~mission(dropoff1|address) for us.\n\nGonna be honest with you, part of why weâre not doing this one ourselves is itâs probably gonna be a mess. See, the confidential materials arrived alongside other boxes in a consignment now stored in their automated vault and the retrieval codes for that are only generated on-site. That means no remote hacking. Our source claims senior staff carry datapads with the codes on it, so youâll have to liberate datapads off them before using the codes at the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. \n\nBut the gigâs got some perks. The consignment includes other crates that we donât really give a crap about that are probably worth something too. \n\nSo what do you say?\n\n- Bit Zeros \n

blacjac_RetrieveConsignment_desc_001=ATTN: Mercenaries with Cargo Handling Experience\n\nNine Tails are currently assaulting one of our facilities at ~mission(Location|address). As they just received a delivery of confidential materials, we donât believe this is a coincidence. BlacJac needs someone to hurry to the location and secure these important boxes before the Nine Tails do. You are authorized to use lethal force against any who attempt to stop you. \n\nAs part of our standard security protocol, the confidential materials were integrated into another consignment and secured in the automated vault. Youâll need to find the relevant retrieval codes for the consignment and enter it at the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. Retrieval codes are stored locally on datapads and only given to high-ranking staff, so youâll have to locate them first. Hopefully theyâre alive to help you, but considering the complete comms blackout, we fear thatâs not the case.  \n\nOnce youâve gathered all the confidential materials, they will need to be delivered to ~mission(dropoff1|address).

I need you to get down there and destroy the drugs theyâre storing on site.\n\nThere's a good chance the facility isn't abandoned, so you might run into these thugs when you head down there, so be ready for a fight.

I need you to get down there and destroy the drugs theyâre storing on site.\n\nThey wonât be happy about it, so youâll probably have a fight on your hands, but the important thing is clearing out the product.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"

The hope is youâll be able to put together a response team and help BlacJac shut them down for good. Our most recent intel has their sub-capital ship and heavily armed escorts flying over at ~mission(Location|Address).\n \nIâd recommend making sure youâve got an up-to-date imprint before heading out. Just in case. \n\nGood luck,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_desc_HRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nYour next bounty, ~mission(TargetName), is definitely considered a high-risk target for good reason. Theyâre known to travel with some serious firepower and are escorted by enough protection to make anyone think twice about picking a fight.\n\nSources indicate that ~mission(TargetName|Last) is hiding out over at ~mission(Location|Address). When you head out to track them down, just make sure youâre prepared. Might even think about bringing along some backup yourself.  \n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_desc_LRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nBounty came in for a low-risk target by the name of ~mission(TargetName). The target themselves isnât all that much to worry about, but it seems that they typically fly in a pack, so thereâs a high chance theyâll have a few friends along when you track them down.\n\nSpeaking of, Iâd start the hunt over at ~mission(Location|Address) since we have reports of them being spotted in the area.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_desc_MRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nNeed you to sort out ~mission(TargetName), a moderate-risk bounty last seen at ~mission(Location|Address) flying a small, multicrew ship. \n\nWe werenât able to get details on exactly what they were piloting, but it seems they did have a few other ships with them.

blacjac_bounty_desc_VHRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nBlacJac just got word that a very high-risk target, ~mission(TargetName), was spotted moving through the flight lanes over at ~mission(Location|Address) piloting a formidable ship with a heavy escort.  \n\nWe want this bounty closed out before they commit any more crimes. Gather whatever resources or support you need, and head out as soon as you can.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_desc_VLRT=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nGot a very low-risk target I need you to take care of: ~mission(TargetName).\n\nTheir last known location was ~mission(Location|Address).\n\nThis is a low threat bounty, so I expect you to be able to clear it pretty fast. They typically fly a small ship and donât have very many known acquaintances. It doesn't get much more straightforward than that.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"\n
blacjac_bounty_desc_intro=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nNot sure if youâre interested, but BlacJac is looking to expand our roster of bounty hunters. We got more jobs than our current contractors can handle, so Iâm hoping that you might be able to help pick up some of the slack.  \n\nYour qualifications look good on paper, but before we make anything official, BlacJac needs to see how you perform in the field firsthand. Even got a test case all lined up â we want you to sort out ~mission(TargetName). They were last seen at ~mission(Location|Address). Should be a fairly straightforward bounty without too much resistance.

blacjac_bounty_fps_desc_first=ATTN: Bounty Hunters\n\nI have more bounties than I have bounty hunters at the moment, so I'm looking to expand our roster. \n\nIf you do a good job on this first one, there'll be more contracts to follow. \n\nLet's see how you do trying to deal with the bounty on ~mission(TargetName).

blacjac_danger_001=Be prepared to meet heavy resistance on this one. If they get wind of what you're doing, they're not going to take it sitting down.Â 
blacjac_danger_002=Knowing this area and the kind of people we're dealing with, my gut says head in expecting a fight.Â 
blacjac_danger_003=You'll be kicking a bit of a hornet's nest on this one, so be ready for heavy resistance.Â 
blacjac_danger_004=This perp is a bit of lightweight. Only a few known associates and they typically fly solo crafts. Shouldn't be to hard to catch them.Â 
blacjac_danger_005=The files on ~mission(TargetName|Last) show that they typically captain a mid-sized multicrew vessel and have been known to employ extra muscle on jobs. Might want to approach with a bit of caution.Â 
blacjac_danger_006=Be sure that you're ready to face heavy resistance. ~mission(TargetName|Last) is known to captain larger ships and with their connections you can almost guarantee that they're not traveling alone.Â 
blacjac_destroyprobe_desc_0001=ATTN: Mercenaries with Demo Experience\n\nWe have a problem over at ~mission(Location|Address). Apparently someone set up PDC Monitors to illegally skim data. \n\nYou are being tasked with locating the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) and destroying them. \n\nThere are a few possible complications:\n- These things are designed to operate passively with as low of an EM sig as possible. Finding them might take some effort and thorough scanning. \n- Monitors like these often have automatic security protocols so that if they are attacked, they begin to transmit any stored dated. It's vital you destroy them before the upload can finish.\n- ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)\n- ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nI'm hopeful you'll be able to resolve the issue before any more data is stolen.\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroyprobe_desc_0002=ATTN: Mercenaries with Demo Experience\n\nReceived a report that some enterprising criminal has been skimming data from ~mission(Location|Address) using PDC Monitors. \n\nYou are being tasked to locate the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) and destroy them. I suspect it might take a bit of scanning to locate the monitors as they're designed to operate passively. Plus, as soon as you start attacking, their security countermeasures are going to kick in and attempt to upload their data-drives. You'll need to be fast enough to prevent the transfer. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nThanks for taking care of this,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroyprobe_desc_0003=ATTN: Mercenaries with Demo Experience\n\nI need a merc who can handle locating and destroying PDC monitors that have been illegally skimming data from ~mission(Location|Address). This will take some doing as the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) will be operating passively and difficult to find without performing a thorough scan of the area. Plus, you'll have to destroy the monitors before their emergency defense system uploads any more of the data they've stolen.\n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"

blacjac_destroystash_desc_001=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nWe're looking for experienced professionals to participate in a raid on a suspected narcotics stash known as ~mission(Location|Address). We need to clear them out before they have a chance to move the product to another site.\n\nWe need you to secure and destroy any and all narcotics found at the stash using whatever means necessary, so go nuts. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\nYou'll be paid out for however much of the contraband you personally destroy. Basically, feel free to engage with any lowlifes you come across, but that's not what you're getting paid for - BlacJac's focus for this op is the drugs. \n\nGood luck,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroystash_desc_002=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nAn informant provided us with info on a narcotics stash known as ~mission(Location|Address). We're organizing a raid to go in and destroy every last bit of contraband being stored there before they have a chance to move it.\n\nYou're tasked with destroying all narcotics found at the site using whatever means necessary... within reason. Basically, do what you can to keep most of the surrounding area intact. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\nYou'll be paid based on how much of the drug stash you personally clear out. Getting this product off the streets is a huge win for BlacJac, and of course the people of ArcCorp.\n\nGood hunting,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_destroystash_desc_003=ATTN: Verified Mercenary Operators\n\nThe location of long suspected narcotics stash known as ~mission(Location|Address) has finally been confirmed and we need to raid the site before they have a chance to migrate again. \n\nDestroy any and all drugs found at the site using whatever means you have. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)\n\nAnd remember, you'll be reimbursed based on how much of the narcotics you personally eliminate, not how many drug dealers you wipe out. Leadership's focus right now is the drugs, not the pushers because bodies are cheap. If we disrupt the supply chain enough, we can put the whole syndicate out of business. \n\nGood hunting,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"

blacjac_hackprevent_desc_002=ATTN: Mercs Experienced in CompSec \n\nThere's been an attempted data breach at ~mission(Location|Address), but they haven't bypassed all the security protocols yet. If you hurry, there should be time to prevent them from gaining access to the system. \n\nRemember, don't get distracted by trying to chase down the cryptos, we can deal with them later. The important thing is not letting them into the network.\n\nAppreciate you taking care of this,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_hackprevent_desc_003=ATTN: Mercs Experienced in CompSec \n\nThe data network at ~mission(Location|Address) is under attack, but so far the system's security measures have managed to fend off the infiltration. They won't last forever, though. We need you onsite ASAP to physically halt the network intrusion before they can crack through. \n\nThink you can handle that?\n\nCounting on you,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"

Find ~mission(TargetName|Last) and retrieve the ~mission(Item) from them. ~mission(Contractor|RecoverSpaceTimed)~mission(Danger)\n\nOnce safely in your possession, you can drop the recovered stuff off at ~mission(Destination|Address).\n\nThanks for your help on this,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_recoverspace_desc_0002=ATTN: Mercs / Bounty Hunters with Cargo Handling Experience\n\n36 hours ago, a location under BlacJac's protection was hit. We've managed to apprehend the people responsible, but they sold off the stolen goods before we got to them. Thankfully, we've learned that a perp named ~mission(TargetName) is possession of the ~mission(Item). \n\nI would like you to recover the stolen property from ~mission(TargetName|Last) and deliver it to ~mission(Destination|Address). ~mission(Contractor|RecoverSpaceTimed)~mission(Danger)\n\n\nBest,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_recoverspace_desc_0003=ATTN: Mercs / Bounty Hunters with Cargo Handling Experience\n\nAn investigation into a string of robberies has led us to a suspect by the name of ~mission(TargetName). We have every reason to believe that they may still have the ~mission(Item) they recently stole in their possession. \n\nIf we strike quickly enough, we should be able to catch them before they fence it to the black market. That's where you come in - track down ~mission(TargetName|Last), reclaim the stolen property and fly it back to ~mission(Destination|Address). ~mission(Contractor|RecoverSpaceTimed)~mission(Danger)\n\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"
blacjac_recoverspace_desc_intro=ATTN: Mercs / Bounty Hunters with Cargo Handling Experience\n\nWe just got word that a thief by the name of ~mission(TargetName) is flying around with their most recent score aboard their ship.\n\nNormally, we'd have someone arrest the bastard and be done with it, but right now the most important thing is that the stolen goods are recovered. \n\nIf this sounds like your kind of thing, you will be authorized to track down ~mission(TargetName|Last), secure the stolen ~mission(Item) however you can, and deliver it to ~mission(Destination|Address). ~mission(Contractor|RecoverSpaceTimed)~mission(Danger)\n\n\nThanks,\nGloria Mesa\n\nPrivate Contract Supervisor\nBlacJac Security, "Protection Provided"

ccdemo19_desc=Helluva job on that last gig. So good that when I was talking to a client of mine who works for some corp and was looking for a solid team. I instantly thought of you.\n\nTheir company heard that microTech is developing a cutting edge compression algorithm that could potentially put them out of business, so needless to say, they're very motivated in getting their hands on it and they're willing to pay handsomely.Â \n\nThe problem is that the program is being developed in one of microTech's off-site research facilities. Traffic into the base is heavily regulated, so you will need to steal an ID to make them think you are one of the workers. Security will be heavy, but I trust you will have ways to evade them.\n\nOnce you steal the code, I will provide you with a location for the drop away from prying eyes.

civilian_localdelivery_holiday_desc_001=Happy Luminalia!\n\nI have a huge favor to ask. Thanks to some very ill timed maintenance issues, my ship is out of commission for at least a week and I won't be able to finish delivering presents to everyone on my gift list.\n\nLooked into using FTL but with their holiday pricing I'll end up paying more credits than what the gifts cost! \n\nFigured I would see if you're interested in helping me out. I get my gifts delivered on time and you get some extra Luminalia spending credits. \n\nThe three gifts are wrapped and waiting at  ~mission(Pickup1|Address). One is for ~mission(GiftRecipient1|First) over at ~mission(DropOff1), another's for ~mission(GiftRecipient2|First) at ~mission(DropOff2), and the last one is for ~mission(GiftRecipient3|First) who's at ~mission(DropOff3).\n\nThanks in advance and may your light glow a little brighter this year!\n\nSincerely,\n~mission(GiftSender|First)
civilian_localdelivery_holiday_desc_002=I'm in desperate need of a little Luminalia magic and I hope you're the one to help.\n\nThere are three gifts stuck at  ~mission(Pickup1|Address) that need to be delivered. \n\nI tried scheduling a pick up but just got notified that they won't be able to make it until after the holidays. Would you be able to take care of the deliveries for me? I'll gladly pay you what I was going to give them.\n\nIt shouldn't be too hard. One is for ~mission(GiftRecipient1) over at ~mission(DropOff1), another's for ~mission(GiftRecipient2) at ~mission(DropOff2), and the last one is for ~mission(GiftRecipient3) who's at ~mission(DropOff3).\n\nWhatever you decide to help or not, I hope you have a very happy holiday!\n\n- ~mission(GiftSender)
civilian_localdelivery_holiday_desc_003=Hope the holiday season is treating you well.\n\nMine's been a bit stressful so far. It turns out that I put the wrong delivery address on a handful of gifts and I'm desperately seeking a way to get them delivered on time. \n\nIt would mean so much to me if you could get me out of this jam. \n\nThe presents are at  ~mission(Pickup1|Address) and will need to be delivered to: \n- ~mission(GiftRecipient1) at ~mission(DropOff1)\n- ~mission(GiftRecipient2) at ~mission(DropOff2)\n- ~mission(GiftRecipient3) at ~mission(DropOff3).\n\nThank you and best holiday wishes,\n~mission(GiftSender)
civilian_localdelivery_holiday_desc_004=I know things get busy around the holidays, but I was reaching out to see if you had any extra time to do a delivery run.\n\nGot a few presents at ~mission(Pickup1|Address)  for close friends that I won't be able to deliver myself. \nYou would need to take one to ~mission(GiftRecipient1) at ~mission(DropOff1), another to ~mission(GiftRecipient2) at ~mission(DropOff2), and the last to ~mission(GiftRecipient3) at ~mission(DropOff3).\n\nMuch appreciated,\n~mission(GiftSender)

commarray_hack_danger_0003=I'm not expecting trouble, but knowing what security is like in that sector, it's not out of the question.Â 
commarray_hack_danger_0004=If I'm being honest, these ~mission(Client) had one of their own try to handle the array, and they got taken out. Just don't let the same thing happen to you. Go in prepared, you should come out fine.Â 
commarray_hack_desc=~mission(Description)
commarray_hack_desc_0001=A couple of ~mission(Client) are working on a big score and they need ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) shut down to make sure they get some privacy. Once it's offline, we'll need you to hang out there to make sure the commlink stays down long enough. ~mission(Danger)\n\nAnd DON'T forget, you'll need a CRYPTOKEY to access the array's controls. \nBring your own if you want, but you can head to ~mission(Location|Address) and grab one there.\nHate for you to head all the way out to the array and not be able to do the damn job.
commarray_hack_desc_0002=~mission(MissionLocation|Address) being online's going to be a problem for some ~mission(Client) working the area. \nShut it down, keep it offline 'til the job's complete, and we'll make it worth your while. ~mission(Danger)\n\nOf course, you won't be able to access the array's controls unless you have a CRYPTOKEY with you. \nWe arranged for one to be waiting for you at ~mission(Location|Address) if you don't already have one.Â 
commarray_hack_desc_0003=I don't want to get too specific, but let's just say it would be better for everyone if someone could make sure that ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) was taken out of commission and that it stayed that way for a while. ~mission(Danger)\n\nAnd I shouldn't have to mention this, but for the love of everything, bring a CRYPTOKEY with you. Last thing we need is you showing up unprepared. \nActually, you know what, if you don't already have one, there's a cryptokey at ~mission(Location|Address) that you can use.
commarray_hack_desc_0004=Certain ~mission(Client) have a job in the works, but they can't do it as long as the ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) is still online. Need a systems-grok to disable the comm uplink, and stay onsite long enough to make sure there aren't any issues. ~mission(Danger) Credits on completion. No up-front.Â \n\n---> REMINDER: Bring a CRYPTOKEY with you to hack the array's controls. Either grab one from ~mission(Location|Address) or bring your own.
commarray_hack_desc_0005=Here's the breakdown -Â  ~mission(MissionLocation|Address) needs to be taken offline, and ~mission(Client) are looking to hire a hacker to do it and guarantee the uplink's down for as long as needed. ~mission(Danger)That's about all you need to know.\n\n*** P.S.

commarray_repair_danger_0004=Shouldn't have to say this, but use some common sense when you're out there and be ready just in case you run in to some trouble.Â 
commarray_repair_danger_0005=One thing to keep in mind is that you should probably make sure your security measures are up to snuff before going.

confirmkill_desc_0001=There's a rumor floating around that this hatjob by the name of ~mission(TargetName) is finally kissing stardust. Talk about overdue. Problem is that it's just a rumor for now. The ~mission(Client) are willing to cough up some credits to find out if it's true. ~mission(Timed)If you head to ~mission(Location) and confirm, you'll get a nice little payout for your troubles. ~mission(Danger)
confirmkill_desc_0002=I keep telling people you gotta vet before you hire, but do they listen? Course not. Take the ~mission(Client) for example. They paid some alleyscag to off ~mission(TargetName), but now they're worried the job might not actually be done and they want someone to go out to ~mission(Location) and verify the hit. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)Interested?
confirmkill_desc_0003=Another job of mine was supposed to be all wrapped up, but now the ~mission(Client) are worried that ~mission(TargetName) might still be upright. To ease their minds, I told them I'd send someone out to ~mission(Location) and make sure that people who are supposed to be dead stayed that way. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)  
confirmkill_desc_0004=Not sure if you heard yet, apparently ~mission(TargetName) is dead. Like dead, dead. Everyone is scrambling to find out if it's true or not, but I got a lead on where the body might be. ~mission(Timed)Head to ~mission(Location) and confirm for me, I'll make sure it's worth your while. ~mission(Danger)
confirmkill_desc_0005=The ~mission(Client) paid big credits to have this problem of theirs permanently solved, but I guess the proof of death didn't come through. Sucks for them, but works out for me and you. I can't go myself, but I can give you the location of ~mission(Location). Go and confirm that ~mission(TargetName) is toe up. ~mission(Danger)Simple enough job, don't even have to kill anyone yourself, and the credits are right. ~mission(Timed)
confirmkill_desc_0006=Hope you don't mind corpses, cause I need you to get up close and personal with one. Used to go by the name ~mission(TargetName). You should find what's left of them at ~mission(Location) and hopefully confirm that the bastard's really dead. ~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)Anything else you find when you're out there is fair game.
confirmkill_desc_0007=Got word that ~mission(TargetName) might be dead. 'Might' ain't gonna cut it with me, so I want you to go to ~mission(Location) and make sure of it.~mission(Timed)~mission(Danger)If you have any other questions, just figure it out yourself. That's what I pay you for.

covalexrand_desc_0001=Been waiting forever for Covalex to get their act together after the accident they had, but I just don't think it's going to happen at this point. Hoping you could go out to Gundo and grab my order for me. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed)I don't need you to take it all the way to me either. I arranged for shipment from ~mission(Destination) so all you'd have to do is leave it there at the front desk for me.\n\nThanks,\n~mission(Owner)
covalexrand_desc_0002=I had an important shipment with Covalex and apparently it was waiting at Gundo when they had that big accident there. They said the delivery was going to be delayed, but it's been months now and they're still telling me the same exact thing. No new information or anything. I'm losing a ton of money on this and the best they can offer me is an apology. Not good enough. Figure if they can't finish the delivery, I'll find someone who can. ~mission(Reference) Need it delivered to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0003=Hey, a gift I ordered is stuck out on that Covalex station that exploded or whatever and now they say they can't deliver it. I'm really sorry about what happened there, but I already missed our anniversary and if I miss their birthday too, I'm gonna be dead. Basically, I need that box to be at ~mission(Destination) by any means necessary. ~mission(Reference) ~mission(Timed) 
covalexrand_desc_0004=Look, we can all agree it was a real tragedy what happened out there at Gundo, and I'm sorry people lost their lives, but that doesn't mean I don't need my package delivered, right? And if Covalex isn't willing or able to do it, then I have every right to go and get delivered on my own. That only seems fair. ~mission(Reference)If you're interested, I'll need it taken to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Timed)\n\nGood luck,\n~mission(Owner)
covalexrand_desc_0005=I'm in a bit of a bind. A delivery I've been expecting was rerouted through Covalex's Gundo station out near Crusader, but an accident there stopped all shipments. I tried getting a refund, but the company I ordered from says it's Covalex's fault, and Covalex says that their terms of service covers a delay like this. ~mission(Timed)I guess at this point I just want my package and I don't really care how I get it. Even to the point where I'm willing to pay the extra shipping to have someone just take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. ~mission(Reference)
covalexrand_desc_0006=I need someone with access to a ship to fly out to Covalex's Gundo station and take a box there to ~mission(Destination). ~mission(Reference)And before you get the wrong idea or anything, I'm not talking about stealing or anything, because it's my package. Covelex is just dragging their feet delivering it because of the investigation or safety or whatever excuse they're using. ~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0007=A package I ordered is stuck because of the accident that happened at Gundo. I paid good creds for this and now it's just sitting there gathering dust. Seems to me that if Covalex isn't gonna do anything about it, then I might as well pay someone to find it and take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. ~mission(Reference)~mission(Timed)
covalexrand_desc_0008=I am going crazy. Covalex keeps telling me that they delivered my package, but I didn't get it. The last routing information I have places it at their Gundo center, so I'm thinking that it got misplaced when they had the big accident there. ~mission(Item) If you could go check it out, I bet you anything that it's just sitting there. ~mission(Reference)If it is there, I'll pay to have you bring it to ~mission(Destination).

covalexspec_description_0001=Hi,\n\nI'll totally understand if you don't want to help with this, but if you can it would be amazing.\n\nSee, my boyfriend passed away during the Covalex Gundo tragedy. They said I would get all of Scott's stuff back once the investigation was complete, but as far as I know, it's been done for a while now and they still haven't given any indication of when I can get his property. It's been hard enough dealing with all this, and knowing that a package is going to show up in a month or two and rip open all these wounds, it's just too much. I would prefer to deal with it now and get it over with. If you could find a way to get his personal effects (Employee ID# 104) and drop them off at ~mission(Destination), I'd be very grateful.\n\nThanks for your help,\nAnya
covalexspec_description_0002=My brother was one of those people who died when that Covalex station near Crusader blew. Even worse, he was borrowing something of mine when it happened. Now some red tape asshole is trying to tell me that I have to wait to get my stuff back. Yeah right. First you kill my brother and now you want me to be patient? The nerve of these corporate jillos. Forget that. Instead, I figured I'd hire someone to go to Gundo to get my stuff and take it to ~mission(Destination) for me. I mean, what the hell are they gonna do about it? Anyway, it's what my brother would have wanted. It's gonna be the box marked 156.\n\n- Ed
covalexspec_description_0003=Hey,\n\nSo this is a little awkward for me to talk about, but it turns out that one of the people who passed away on that Covalex station disaster, Kyomi Santos, actually bequeathed me something in her will. I was surprised to hear it, but apparantly I'm now the proud owner of everything stored in box #173. The people at Covalex say I'll be able to get it when the station opens back up but ... this is the awkward part ... I kind of really need it right now. Normally I'd just wait, but I'm trying to start my own business (I make cakes in the shape of people's homeworlds) and the credits I get from selling it will really be a huge help. I've got a little bit stashed away now that I can use to pay for someone to deliver it from Gundo to ~mission(Destination) for me. I know the whole things a little bit irregular, but if there was any other way I wouldn't be asking.\n\nThanks for the help,\nThrace
covalexspec_description_0004=My son Nico was sadly among the victims of the tragic accident at Covelex's Gundo station and they still haven't returned all of his personal possessions to me. I understand that they have to do things according to regulations, but it seems unconscionable that they wouldn't make some allowances for the grieving family members. To that end, I'm seeking someone who will be able to go to the station for me. To be clear, Gundo is currently considered off limits, meaning that this would not be above board, but I feel my situation warrants special consideration. My sister says that the rate I am offering is the correct amount for retrieving the crate with Nico's belongings (#964) and bringing them to ~mission(Destination), so hopefully I can find a competent individual to settle this matter quickly.\n\nSincerely,\nGloria Theolone
covalexspec_description_0005=They said that I could find someone here to go to Gundo for me and grab a crate that belonged to my wife. If the name didn't ring a bell, that's the station where they had that big accident. My wife worked for Covalex and I know it's not really going to make losing her any easier, but I really just want Claudia's stuff back. I think about her photo collection or the necklace I gave her just sitting there in that cold dead station in some box marked 249 and it's not right. She deserves better. So how about it? You willing to go to Gundo and haul her crate back to ~mission(Destination)?
covalexspec_description_0006=Hi,\n\nI'm looking for someone to head to the Covalex Gundo station near Crusader and grab some items. I know this may sound like stealing, but it's my dad's stuff. You see, he was on Gundo station when it had its accident. My mom says that we need to wait until Covalex says so, but I don't think that's fair because I miss him so much. I would like something to remember him by and I don't want to wait any longer because I might start forgetting things. I'll pay you to get box 510 for me and take to ~mission(Destination) so I can have it.\n\nThank you very much,\nBaylor Ward

There's a few extra creds coming your way if you do.
criminal_recoverstash_desc_04=Thank the stars that dumb outlaws will always talk too much when they're hopped up on rot.

criminal_recoverstash_desc_05=Not a lot of people know this but, a few days ago my stash got raided by some clueless fetchlicks who decided robbing me was a smart thing to do.\n\nWell, it turns out it wasn't cause I was able to track the numcells down to where they're hiding. You're gonna go teach them a lesson for me and get my stuff back.\n\nI want you to -\n* go to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation)\n* find all my stolen stash\n* bring it back to ~mission(Destination|Address).\n\nNot sure if they'll be hanging around when you get there or not, but if you end up coming across these asshats, I'll see you get some extra creds for the hassle.

criminal_recoverstash_steal_desc_01=It pays to keep an ear open, and in this case, it pays very well.\n\nDiscovered where a nice little treasure is being secreted away, and with your help, we can take it for ourselves.\n\nGo to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation) and  find all of the stash hidden there. You may have to hunt around a bit since its probably wont just be sitting out in the open.\n\nOnce you have it all, bring it back to ~mission(Destination|Address) and I'll pay you your cut.\n\nIt's not clear yet if the site is being guarded or not, but we'll know for sure one way or the other once you're there.

criminal_recoverstash_steal_desc_02=You in the mood for a bit of a treasure hunt? \n\nOne of my crew was snatched recently and overhead some other scavs talking about how they had hidden away some pretty choice loot before being locked up. \n\nYou're going to steal it for me.\n\nGo to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation). That's where they stashed the loot. \n\nOnce there, you're on your own to search the area and find where everything is hidden.\n\nAfter you found all of the stash, haul it over to ~mission(Destination|Address). Payment on delivery.\n\nLast thing. Not all of their gang was caught so there still might be a few hanging around. Don't worry though. If they're there, I'll throw some extra creds your way to make it up to you.
criminal_recoverstash_steal_desc_03=Not sure if you've been hearing the rumors, but I think I figured out where that gang that pulled that big score last week hid everything they stole.\n\nIt's just sitting out there while they wait for the heat to die down. Real shame if anything happened to it...\n\nFor example if someone were to go to ~mission(Contractor|RecoverStashLocation), search around, find where all the stolen loot is, and bring all of it to ~mission(Destination|Address). \n\nBet a person who did something like that would stand to make a lot of credits.\n\nOf course the biggest risk would be if there were guards in the area, but if that were the case, I'm sure a bonus payment would make it worth the trouble.

crusader_danger_005=Our records show that it is very likely the target will be in a lighter craft with a small wing of similarly outfitted allies. Should be a fairly straight forward encounter if everything works out.
crusader_danger_006=Our best intel indicates that you should expect to encounter moderate hostile forces on this one. We're looking at possibly a small multicrew craft supported by a light to moderate escort wing. Plan accordingly.Â 
crusader_danger_007=From what information we have been able to gather, the target may be traveling in multicrew vessel with a full, well-armed escort. Approach with caution.
crusader_danger_008=I should warn you that it is very likely you will face heavy resistance - a large multicrew ship with heavy escort support. Be ready. 
crusader_danger_009=The target you are after is considered to be a severe-risk. Expect heavy resistance along the lines of a sub-capital vessel with a flight of heavy escorts. This contract should not be undertaken lightly.
crusader_danger_high_001=We're expecting them to put up significant resistance and do not recommend attempting this contract alone. \n\nCREW NOTE: You are expected to staff your own combat team before embarking on this contract.\n\n
crusader_danger_high_002=Be mindful that these aren't some low tier operators you're going to be facing. They have considerable offensive capabilities at their disposal and a willingness to use them. \n\nCREW NOTE: You will likely need additional manpower if you're going to be successful.\n\nÂ

crusader_destroyprobe_desc_0001=Recent intel reports indicate that local criminal elements are operating the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) around ~mission(Location|Address) to case potential targets. \n\nSince monitors like this are designed to be unobtrusive, it makes finding them a real pain.

We need you to search the area locate the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) and destroy them. They use a passive form of data collection so they're going to be pretty hard to spot. Make sure that you scan the area carefully to find them. On the bright side though, once you attack one, they'll light up into emergency data transfer mode.

destroyprobeillegal_desc=~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDescription)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0001=The ~mission(Contractor|Name) are fed up with their ops getting busted near ~mission(Location). Turns out, there's ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) in the area listening in on everything we do. No wonder they keep getting busted. Take care of the problem for them and there's a nice little payday waiting. \n\nJust know that you'll need to scan the area since PDC Monitors like this are a pain in the ass to find and they're programmed to package up their data once they're hit, so knock 'em out quick. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0002=The area around ~mission(Location) has become a huge headache for some associates of mine since security's listening in on anything said or done out there. The ~mission(Contractor|Name) found ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) nearby and need someone special to go hunt down these sneaky little PDC Monitors. They're a real pain in the ass to find, but having to scan the area for them's only half the problem. \n\nOnce you take a shot, boom, they're programmed to shut down and upload their data back to central. You gotta blast them to bits before they finish. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0003=Interested in a little target practice? Head over to ~mission(Location) and turn security's bloody annoying spy monitors into scrap. There's ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) out there and nobody's been able to find the stupid things either since they barely put out a sig while they're collecting data. \n\nAnyway, the entire situation has been particularly frustrating for the ~mission(Contractor|Name), which is why they're paying for someone to scan the area and eliminate the threat. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)One last thing, they're rigged to dump their data when they're shot, so kill 'em quick.
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0004=Not sure if you've heard the rumors but arrests have spiked around ~mission(Location). security's showing up at jobs and sweeping everybody to the clink. Weren't dumb luck either. Cru-Sec was waiting for them. So, I did a little recon and discovered ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) surveilling the area. Plenty of people, including the ~mission(Contractor|Name), want this inconvenience eliminated. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)\n\nI can guarantee good creds and my eternal gratitude if you do it. Hunt down the PDC Monitors by scanning for wherever they're hiding, and attack hard and fast before they get a chance to upload any data they've collected. Once they're gone, we can all get back to good, ol' fashioned criminalizing. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0005=You been by ~mission(Location) recently? ~mission(Contractor|Name) told me that security set up ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) to spy on anyone passing by. I'm not against a little law and order, that's what makes the game the game, but this goes too far. Let's just say that I'm not the only one who shares this sentiment. ~mission(Contractor|Name) are even paying to restore the balance. \n\nThese PDC Monitors are a pain to find so you'll need to scan the area. Plus, when you engage, you'll need to destroy them before they finish uploading all the dirt they've scraped up. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)
destroyprobeillegal_desc_0006=Security thinks they're so smart. They set up ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) near ~mission(Location) to gather intel on the ~mission(Contractor|Name). Didn't take long before someone figured it out. So, feel like getting paid to literally blow up their stupid scheme? All you got to do is be the one to actually scan the area to find where the PDC Monitors are hiding and take 'em out. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)Another thing to keep in mind, these things are wired to protect the info they're pulling, so once you shoot, you gotta destroy them all before they can upload all their data.

destroyprobelegal_desc_0001=We've received intel from ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeInformant) that local criminal elements are operating ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) around ~mission(Location|Address) to eavesdrop on security forces. As such, authorization has been given to enlist private contractors to help eliminate these devices.Â  You'll need to carefully scan the area once you arrive to identify the exact location of the ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount). Since they passively skim information, they can be tricky to find.\n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)\n\nWord of warning, outlaws tend to rig these PDC Monitors with defensive protocols to automatically back up the data when attacked, so once you start shooting, you'll need to destroy them all quickly before the transfer can finish.
destroyprobelegal_desc_0002=Independent combat operators are needed to eliminate unauthorized surveillance monitors placed around ~mission(Location|Address). According to the initial report, ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeInformant) has identified ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) intercepting data. Scanning the area for their location might be difficult since they have such low EM signatures, but they must be found and destroyed before sensitive intel is leaked. \n\n~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)These 'skimmers' are outfitted with data security protocols. They will begin transferring the data they've gathered when threatened, so operators will need to destroy them before the upload is allowed to complete. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0003=We've received reports that criminal elements have installed ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) around ~mission(Location|Address) to spy on the area. Thankfully, we've finally been given the green light to hire combat operators to attack and destroy these systems. That's where you come in. \n\nYou will need to scan the area to find the PDC Monitors' location before the data illicitly gathered can be uploaded. The 'skimmers' will be in their passive data collection mode when you arrive making the search for them difficult, but know that once attacked, they will begin transmitting the contents of their drives. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0004=We are looking for experienced combat pilots to assist in the destruction of illegal surveillance systems that have been appearing in the sector. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)These outlaw 'skimmers' have contributed to the deaths of security personnel as well as civilians by providing local criminals with intel about security movements and deployments. \n\nYou will be tasked with scanning the area around ~mission(Location|Address) where ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeInformant) has indicated that you'll find ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) in operation. They will be well hidden thanks to their minimal power output. However, once engaged, these monitors will cease being covert and begin to upload their contents. You must destroy them before they complete the transfer otherwise highly sensitive data may be lost. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0005=Outlaw groups have been using ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) to spy on security forces by skimming data transmitted to and from ~mission(Location|Address). We are now actively seeking combat pilots to find and destroy these unauthorized 'skimmers.' ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)Know that it'll be difficult to hunt for their exact location since the monitors are design to only emit the barest of signatures and you may need to perform a thorough scan of the area. \n\nYou are to travel to the area, locate and then destroy all outlaw devices before any more innocent lives are lost. These PDC Monitors are outfitted with a failsafe program that will upload all data when attacked, so you will need to act before this process can complete. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeDanger)
destroyprobelegal_desc_0006=Combat pilots wanted to track and destroy unauthorized surveillance monitors. ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeTimed)These outlaw PDC monitors are a threat to public safety and must be eliminated. You will find ~mission(Contractor|DestroyProbeAmount) near ~mission(Location|Address), but the exact placement remains unknown at this time. Only a careful on-site scan will be able to reveal exactly where these monitors are gathering intel. \n\nOur Security Officers have noted that the devices will start uploading their contents when attacked.

Cross-section missiles (like the type your ship is armed with) focuses its tracking on the ships size and geometry. So the further away you are from the enemy, the harder it is for the missile to track.

dfm_ui_Comstab=COMSTAB is a system which manages your shipâs inertia in turns, tightening your turning circle and keeping your nose pointed where you expect it by use of maneuvering thrusters.\nWithout COMSTAB enabled during a turn your ship would continue to drift along its previous trajectory carrying you wide of your intended destination and requiring the use of other advanced maneuvers such as decoupling and Boost to maintain a good line.\nThe downside of COMSTAB is that your ship will be slowed during turns more than others using these advanced maneuvers.\nYou can cycle the various safeties on and off by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_toggle_safeties)].
dfm_ui_Comstab_Pad=COMSTAB is a system which manages your shipâs inertia in turns, tightening your turning circle and keeping your nose pointed where you expect it by use of maneuvering thrusters.\nWithout COMSTAB enabled during a turn your ship would continue to drift along its previous trajectory carrying you wide of your intended destination and requiring the use of other advanced maneuvers such as decoupling and Boost to maintain a good line.\nThe downside of COMSTAB is that your ship will be slowed during turns more than others using these advanced maneuvers.\nYou can toggle COMSTAB by pressing [~action(spaceship_movement|v_ifcs_toggle_comstab)].

dfm_ui_Control_Frame=The control frame reticle (CFR) shows the goal attitude that your ship is trying to attain. When torque/thruster error or other outside forces prevent the ship from attaining the goal the control frame reticle will deviate from the nose reticle. In these circumstances you should rely on the control frame reticle to pilot the ship as the forward velocity vector will always be in that direction. IFCS will then drive the nose reticle toward the CFR as it corrects the error.

dfm_ui_Countermeasures=When a missile is locked on your ship or an enemy is trying to achieve missile lock, you can attempt to break lock by using a countermeasure.\nTo fire a countermeasure hold [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_launch_countermeasure)].

Decoys burn out quickly so missiles may reacquire lock-on if you fire on too early.\n~icon(Chaff|22|22) The Noise explodes into an expanding cloud of tiny filaments designed to confuse radar systems and break the lock of missiles with an electromagnetic lock-on system.\nYou can cycle the type of countermeasure armed by pressing [~action(spaceship_defensive|v_weapon_cycle_countermeasure_fwd)].

It can take some time to reach maximum cruise velocity and even longer to stop with your retro thrusters so be sure to plan your decelerations accordingly.\nCruise is disabled during Basic Training.
dfm_ui_FlightMode_Cruise_Mode_Title=Flight Modes (3/4)
dfm_ui_FlightMode_Precision=The mode above Precision is Space Combat Maneuvering (SCM).\nThis is the typical mode used in combat and non-combat flight.

dfm_ui_ITTS=With a target focused, your ship's targeting system will try to predict where you need to fire to hit the target with each of your weapons.\nIt does so by extending PIPs (Predicted Impact Point) from your Line of Sight reticule. Each PIP corresponds to a weapon and indicates where its projectiles will intercept given the distance and velocity of the target.\nPIPs are only predicted so if your target is far away it may alter its velocity and avoid the projectile. As a general rule, ballistic projectiles will take longer to reach a target than an energy projectile, therefore their PIPs will be projected further ahead.

distraction_desc_0001=Put down whatever you're doing and pay attention. This is a big one.\n\nThe ~mission(Client) got a massive score cooking, but in order to pull it off, they need an equally massive distraction. \n\nThat's you.\n \nYou're gonna head over to a ~mission(Location) and start nuking everything and everyone you can. ~mission(Wanted)You'll be making so much noise, no one will even care what the ~mission(Client) are up to.
distraction_desc_0002=You ever dream about flying out to some remote ~mission(Location) and shooting everything that moves? Well, guess what? I'm here to make your dreams come true. And not only that, I'm gonna pay you for it.\n\nI can't tell you all the specifics, but the upshot is that the ~mission(Client) are eager to make sure all the security in sector are kept as busy as possible.\n\nNow, it seemed to me that sending someone to rampage at the ~mission(Location) would be a damn good start. ~mission(Wanted)Shouldn't be too hard to keep everyone's attention after that.
distraction_desc_0003=The ~mission(Client) are looking to pay good credits for someone to create a distraction for them. And since I can't figure out how to lure a Vanduul fleet to the sector, a cutthroat like you flying to a ~mission(Location) and unleashing hell might be the next best thing. ~mission(Wanted)\n\nCan you believe some people choose to work in an office for a living?
distraction_desc_0004=Hey. Did you ever hear about the system-wide hunt in Ellis for that slicer a little while back? Advocacy were running in circles for days trying to take them down. Got me thinking. The ~mission(Client) are going after a huge score soon and then I thought, why not just arrange for something similar to happen here? Get all the security in the area chasing after a target so that they're blind to whatever else is going on. It would make the ~mission(Client) job a billion times easier. \n\nHere's how it'll work. You fly to a ~mission(Location) and unleash some major chaos and destruction. They already patrol places like that pretty heavily so you should have company in no time flat. ~mission(Wanted)To be honest, I'm starting to wonder if that thing in Ellis wasn't just a distraction, too.

distraction_wanted_0001=And to be clear, the only way this is going to work is if you can keep a level 5 crimestat on your head the whole time. Anything less and it won't draw the kind of heat we need.Â 
distraction_wanted_0002=There's a caveat to this whole thing, though. With the amount of attention I want on you, your crimestat needs to stay at a level 5 minimum. It's the only way to guarantee that all eyes are on you.Â 
distraction_wanted_0003=Of course, an ordinary two-bit criminal won't be enough to get the whole sector engaged. No, you gonna need to rock a level 5 crimestat to create the chaos I'm after.Â 
distraction_wanted_0004=But the way I figure it, just showing up won't be enough. We need you to maintain a level 5 crimestat the whole time. That way we make sure every do-gooder in the sector will be racing to take you down.Â

distractionkill_desc_0001=I heard that you're big time now with your level 5. Normally, I'd be telling you to keep your head down and till the heat blows over, but it just so happens that I got a better use for you.\n\nI've been working on something big that's ready to go down, but in order to make it happen I need someone to create a distraction that's even bigger. That's where you come in. \n\nThe way I figure it, if you take out ~mission(KillCount) Navy humps, just about every screw in the entire Empire will be focused on dragging your ass down. \n\nCan't be lower sec either. Needs to be Navy to really pull this off. That's fine though, any security gets wind of a level 5 and they'll comm the Navy to come deal with you.\n\nAnd you have to do it fast enough so that the timing works out. As soon as you open fire on the first one, the clock starts.\n\nThink you can handle that?
distractionkill_desc_0002=I'll be honest with you, I usually don't like to deal with your kind of crazy, but a mad dog is exactly what I need right now. \n\nMy crew and I need all the security in the system kept busy for a while and the only way I see that happening is if you bring down enough Navy that they don't have a choice but to stop everything and focus on you. I think about ~mission(KillCount) starmen should do it. \n\nLucky thing is, with your level 5, they should be chasing you anyway. Security stops to scan you and the Navy's gonna come straight to you. Just make sure that once you start shooting that you finish the job. As soon as you engage with the first one, the clock starts and if you don't raise the stakes high enough, me and my crew are gonna be left hanging.\n\nOf course, feel free to kill even more of the bastards if the mood takes you.
distractionkill_desc_0003=Word on the wire is that every flattop with a badge is out there scanning the system for your level 5 wanted ass. What do you say to making some credits off all that hassle?\n\nI can't tell you exactly what's going down, but it's enough for you to know that I need a cataclysmic level distraction. The kind that can only be created by a dangerous and deranged criminal going on a shooting spree and taking out ~mission(KillCount) Navy starmen. \n\nOnce you start shooting, my crew will move into place, so you'll have to finish the job quick. And Navy only. Popping off some Advos or local security won't cut it. Fortunately, with your crimestat anytime you run into security, Navy shouldn't be far behind.\n\nGet this done for me, and I'll see that you get your fair cut.

ea_ui_mapdesc_BrokenMoon=Formerly part of Kellar's Run, Taranis system is one of the more notorious and dangerous places in the known systems. The vast fields of asteroids offer plenty of hiding places for assassins and bushwhackers.
ea_ui_mapdesc_CaplanCircuit=Race through the intricate framework and sharp turns of the Caplan Industrial Platform, just a short flight away from the August Dunlow Spaceport. The Caplan Circuit is a rite of passage for all local racers.
ea_ui_mapdesc_Crossroads=Discovered in 2445, the United Nations of Earth was conflicted about what to do with the Nexus system. Since the only jump point at the time was through Cathcart, they tried to use the system as a dedicated military training system, but budget issues forced the government to sell exclusive access to the system to the Hathor Group in a deal that ultimately inspired the sale of Stanton System centuries later. Hathor indiscriminately stripped the system of its resources then abandoned it. Over the decades, outlaws, squatters, and refugees began to move in as the system slipped into obscurity. It wasnât until 2931 when Dean Kellarâs infamous run that the UEE realized how dangerous and entrenched these criminals had become and decided to take it back.\n\nThe year is now 2934. The UEE is still attempting to restore order by sweeping out the outlaws and squatters who have taken residence in the system. Play as a member of the UEE Advocacy tactical team, led by SAC Darrell Lincoln, or an outlaw in the Supreme gang, led by Leoni âZombieâ Kulkov, in the battle for the Hathor Mining Facility on Nexus III.
ea_ui_mapdesc_Demien=Originally built by the Hathor Group for the workers attempting to terraform Nexus II, OP Station Demien has earned a much darker reputation as the site of the infamous Walzer Massacre of 2935.
ea_ui_mapdesc_DemienComms=Originally built by the Hathor Group for the workers attempting to terraform Nexus II, OP Station Demien has earned a much darker reputation as the site of the infamous Walzer Massacre of 2935. The Comms Center was a main hub of the station.
ea_ui_mapdesc_DogfightTest=Special map for Dogfight Testing
ea_ui_mapdesc_DunlowDerby=Inspired by the real life underground race through the heart of Orison, this sim map allows pilots to test their mettle and precision handling skills without endangering the local Crusader populace.
ea_ui_mapdesc_DyingStar=Pyro system didn't get its name by accident. The central star is in the middle of the prolonged nova phase, burning out the planets in the system. While dangerous, it's a morbid kind of beauty.
ea_ui_mapdesc_Echo11=A former extraction facility, Echo Eleven was abandoned when the Hathor Group left the Nexus system and has since become a vile den of squatters and outlaws.
ea_ui_mapdesc_GroundArena=A battleground fit for determining which tank or team will reign supreme. 
ea_ui_mapdesc_Icebreaker=Face off against the frigid winds that cover the mountains of the Euterpe Advanced Research Laboratories or bide your time and hope the weather clears. Whatever your choice, know that the Icebreaker takes no prisoners. 
ea_ui_mapdesc_JerichoStation=Completed in 2871, INS Jericho is the main port of call for the UEE Navy in the Stanton system. Named after famed squadron leader Amare Jericho, this station is outfitted to provide logistical support, refueling and resupply options for a variety of capital ships, as well as smaller support and combat vessels.
ea_ui_mapdesc_Kareah=Security Post Kareah was heralded as a next-generation policing station for Crusader Security, yet years of budget shortfalls left it unfinished. Eager to stem the tide of outlaws eager to exploit the stationâs connection to the Advocacyâs secure data network, Crusader Security has recently begun using the facility as a heavily-guarded, evidence storage depot.
ea_ui_mapdesc_LorvilleOutskirts=A sprawling network of interworking cranes, pipes, and industrial machinery line the winding quarry of this active worksite that doubles as the Lorville Outskirts racetrack.
ea_ui_mapdesc_MinersLament=Brave this eerie racetrack on the edge of Yela's asteroid belt. Once the site of a tragic mining disaster, the forsaken machinery and floating derelicts of Miner's Lament will now put your skills and your nerve to the test.
ea_ui_mapdesc_NHS_DeffordLink=A dangerous course that has claimed many aspiring pilots' ships. This crucible isn't always in the Murray Cup's rotation of tracks. Many feel that it's too difficult and unnecessarily risks pilots for better spec broadcasting.
ea_ui_mapdesc_NHS_HalloranCircuit=One of the newest tracks added to the Murray Cupâs rotation, Halloran Circuitâs death-defying turns and dives have made it a fan favorite, drawing incredible viewership to its spectrum broadcasts.
ea_ui_mapdesc_NHS_OldVanderval=One of the oldest active courses in racing. It's no longer considered an eligible race track, so any race here is considered Clean (a term which can encapsulate any amateur, non-pro or underground race). Most pilots have cut their teeth on Old Van so it's one of the more beloved tracks in the Empire.
ea_ui_mapdesc_NHS_RikkordMemorial=A standard fixture in Murray Cup qualifiers, Rikkord Memorial has always been a great separator between the amateurs and the professionals.
ea_ui_mapdesc_NHS_WinnersCircle=The popular sim map, Winnerâs Circle, transforms the iconic aesthetic of the New Horizon Speedway into a combat arena, perfect for honing atmospheric maneuvers and dogfighting skills.
ea_ui_mapdesc_RiverZero=A scenic course that follows the natural bends of the River Zero on microTech. Its natural beauty can be distracting to pilots attempting to follow its winding path while staying above the water but below the tree tops. 
ea_ui_mapdesc_SkyScraper=Challenge the skies above Area18 and conquer the Sky Scraper by narrowly threading your way through towering high-rises and dense urban-sprawl at breakneck speeds.
ea_ui_mapdesc_SnakePit=Weave around pylons, duck under cranes, and avoid precarious pipes in this abandoned mining facility as you strive to prevail over the Snake Pit and its venomous turns.
ea_ui_mapdesc_TheGoodDoctor=Hatfield & Harding had big plans for planet of Mya in the Leir System when they purchased it from Galor Messer IX in 2743. They entrusted the supervision of the terraforming and settlement to Dr. Marcus Fayel from the University of Perseiâs Analytical Research and Quantification campus. Little did they know that Dr. Fayel would not only betray his employees, but he would steal the planet out from under them. On May 3, 2812, all communication with the planet was cut off. Hours later, a single message from Dr. Fayel directed to Hatfield & Harding and the rest of the universe announcing the birth of the Sunâs Eye Fellowship, a new religion based on radical isolationism, and their intent to claim Mya as their own.\n\nFayelâs former employers were furious. Against the wishes of the UEE, they assembled a covert team of mercenaries to secure the planet and eliminate Fayel as well as any followers who got in their way. The operation was a brutal massacre. The Fellowship proved to be more than willing to kill and die for their new leader. The missionâs failure led to the eventual dissolution of Hatfield & Harding and complete control of Mya to Fayel and the Fellowship who became known as the Outsiders.

fine_terminal_informationScreen_Info=\nHow are fines attributed to me?\nMost fines are issued directly by members of law enforcement, but some result from violations detected by ships and mobiGlas and automatically broadcast to the Emergency Communication Network (ECN) system.\n\n\nWhat sort of things can I get fined for?\nFor a complete list of finable offenses and misdemeanors applicable in your current jurisdiction, please consult your mobiGlas.\n\n\nWhy did I receive a fine for something legal elsewhere?\nCertain jurisdictions have different laws. You should always check the legality of your cargo when entering a new jurisdiction.\n\n\nMy ship was stolen, why am I still receiving fines?\nUnless you report your vehicle stolen to law enforcement (this can be easily done at an ASOP terminal), you are still considered the legal owner of the ship and are responsible for certain crimes perpetrated by it.\n\n\nWhy does the Escalated Fine cost more than the initial price?\nTo encourage prompt payment, the Office of Imperial Justice (OIJ) provides offenders a short period where newly acquired fines may be settled at a discounted initial rate. If payment is not made before this period expires, the fine escalates in both price and severity.\n\n\nWhat happens if I donât pay my Escalated Fines?\nIf you accumulate enough unpaid escalated fines you will be issued a crimestat. The heavier your escalated fines, the faster this will happen. The OIJ strongly urges everyone to pay their fines regularly and on time.\n\n\nWhat if I receive a fine in error?\nIf you think you have received a fine in error, please contact the Issue Council. While mistakes are rare, we are trying to improve the system all the time and your feedback is welcome.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_corsair_desc=We at Drake Interplanetary know that sometimes defense isnât just about protecting whatâs yours. Sometimes itâs about striking out and facing the unknown head-on. How can you ever be truly safe if you donât know what threat is waiting beyond the next mountain range, moon, or jump point? \n\nThanks to a large hold capable of stowing a small vehicle and specially designed asymmetric convertible wings, the Corsair adapts gracefully to unfamiliar atmospheres, combat situations, and hot landing zones. Be ready for anything, and youâll never be caught unprepared.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_g12_desc=While larger vehicles like the Tumbril Nova and Anvil Ballista may be better known for their military might, the UEE deploys thousands of smaller tactical vehicles in defense of the Empire. More easily transported to provide greater mission flexibility, these rovers and gravlevs often allow tactical responsiveness to a wider variety of terrain and scenarios. When atmospheric conditions become hostile and can impede flight, having a varied motor pool at your disposal can make all the difference.\n\nOne of the newest rovers to join the ranks is the G12a from Origin Jumpworks. While it may have the sleek lines the manufacturer is known for, the G12a is reinforced with heavier armor and fortified wheels, and comes armed with a full defensive and offensive suite. When deployed, it will initially serve as a patrol vehicle for landing sites located in active combat areas with severe weather patterns.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_hercules_desc=The first active-duty starlifter flight was formed in May 2821, when Crusader Industries delivered a dozen Hercules ships during that yearâs Invictus Launch Week. Capable of deploying armored vehicles in the midst of heavy enemy fire, the Hercules proved invaluable to battlefield operations. This was apparent on March 2824, when UEE armed forces were called upon to put down a heavily armed group of pirate forces located on a frontier world near the Xiâan border. Two Hercules squadrons, escorted by deep space support fighters, quietly deployed troops and an armored column which defeated the stunned criminal forces in short order. The battle, previously thought to be a particularly hazardous prospect, was won with no losses of UEE personnel and the resulting capture of information would lead directly to the destruction of two pirate outposts and a small capital ship.\n\nWith the recent reintroduction of the Tumbril Nova Tank, the Navyâs fleet of Hercules Starlifters has become busier than ever. However, delivering ground combat vehicles is far from the Herculesâ only task during the ongoing war against the Vanduul. With roads destroyed during the course of attacks, the Hercules Starlifter was a vital part in rescue operations on Urial, rapidly flying in earthmovers and cranes to assist in saving countless lives that would have otherwise perished in the rubble. Logistic vehicles like the Hercules are crucial in the Navyâs ability to respond to the shifting needs of the Empire. \n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_kraken_desc=The Kraken has been released and that means one thing, thereâs no putting it back. This attack carrier has changed the way militias operate forever and, when it comes to personal defense, thereâs one thing you never want to be - falling behind.\n\nA protector and a beacon of freedom in an often-cruel universe, Drake Interplanetary has made this capital-class ship available to all those tasked with safekeeping those unable to protect themselves. The Kraken is both a sanctuary and a self-contained war machine ready to take on the most daunting adversaries.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_mercury_desc=Good intel is the key to victory. Thatâs why the UEE Navy is seeking to increase the presence of the Crusader Industries Mercury Star Runner in its fleet this year. Already battle proven on several classified missions, the Mercury has delivered key strategic updates to our forces along the front, including Admiral Bishop himself, that have been the key to multiple hard-earned victories. Especially in âred systemsâ where comm networks may be non-existent, the Mercuryâs ability to carry classified encrypted information has been a boon time and again.\n\nAdditionally, thanks to Crusaderâs inclusion of a programmable kill switch and optimized security configurations, there is a significantly reduced chance of highly classified information falling into enemy hands. Pair that with the Mercuryâs speed, precision, and cutting-edge countermeasures, it becomes easy to see why Navy Intelligence Officers have come to rely on this star runner for ensuring that information is delivered on time and intact. \n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_nautilus_desc=First introduced nearly four centuries ago, Aegis Dynamicsâ Nautilus has made an indelible mark upon the Navyâs long and proud history, but it is just as needed today as when it was introduced during the First Tevarin War. The Nautilus has played a crucial role in the ongoing Vanduul War, using its minelaying capabilities to set up perimeter defenses and define the shape of the conflict.  \n\nOne such example is the mission known as the âHellkite Runâ that was part of Operation Mandrake in the Oberon system. Flown by sapper specialists Squadron 761, aka the Alley Vipers, Nautilus minelayers were used to severely limit the Vanduul escape options. Working tirelessly while the main fleet engaged with enemy forces, they were able to deploy pockets of mines and weapon platforms with such precision that an entire Vanduul squadron was eliminated before they could escape the system to cause additional harm.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_nova_desc=First utilized in the Second Tevarin War, the Nova tank has made a triumphant return to battle in 2948 thanks to efforts of the recently reformed manufacturer Tumbril. Military Historians still recount the original Novaâs performance at the 2605 Battle of Koren Pass where three Nova tanks held off an entire Tevarin strike team for over sixteen hours. While much credit is due to the brave soldiers who fought so valiantly, it is hard to deny that the Novaâs resilience and ferocity allowed for the UEE to prevail that day.\n\nThough they are most commonly found in the Armyâs arsenal, youâll find that Nova tanks are playing a pivotal role in the Navyâs combat operations, protecting tactical encampments across the Vanduul front. Its mobility means that it can quickly and effectively redeploy to provide combat support where needed and its resistance to extreme temperatures mean that the Nova can be posted in any number of environments. Knowing theyâre protected by the Novaâs battery of arms allows pilots and starmen to work more effectively and creates a safer Empire.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_polaris_desc=One of the newest capital ships serving in the fleet, the Polaris-class corvette entered service in 2946 and has already made a big impact on the Empire. Thanks to the vessel's well-balanced mix of power and speed, it has enhanced the Navyâs overall effectiveness in a wide variety of scenarios, from delivering Humanitarian aid to tactical operations.  \n\nUnder the command of Captain Lucia Franco, the UEES Polaris has shown how essential the corvetteâs adaptability is to the ongoing war effort. Recently of note, the Polaris and her crew were on extended patrol in Tayac when they successfully halted an attempted incursion by a Vanduul scouting party, potentially deterring further enemy action in that sector for the foreseeable future. Cpt. Franco attributed the vesselâs above-average quality of life standards to the combat effectiveness of her starmen.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_redeemer_desc=There are few ships that are awaiting deployment as eagerly as the Aegis Dynamics Redeemer. After being featured at two previous Invictus Launch Weeks, the Navy is closer than ever to utilizing the full potential of this cutting-edge gunship. The UEEN has worked closely with Aegis to perfect the Redeemer during this time to ensure that it will meet and exceed all the operational needs of such an advanced vessel. From the early reports arriving from various test squadrons, including the famous 999, the Redeemer is going to be worth the wait. \n\nDesigned to carry significant cargo and troops, the Redeemer will provide support in a variety of combat situations and logistical operations. The state-of-the-art technology employed by Aegis should make the craft one of the easiest to maintain to operational-effective standards. Additionally, the boarding hatch will permit faster transitions in situ while the VectorLock thruster design will allow for optimal maneuvering via its twin nacelles. High Command is eager to see what the Redeemer can do once it finds its way into the hands of enthusiastic pilots across the Naval fleet.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_taurus_desc=Invictus Launch Week celebrates the Navyâs best and brightest, but no celebration would be complete without mention of the hardworking crews aboard the UEE Merchant Navy fleet. These civilian-owned vessels are a vital part of the military supply chain and work tirelessly to ensure that those serving along the frontlines have the provisions they need. For years, the Merchant Navy has relied upon the RSI Constellation Taurus to successfully complete those dangerous runs through hostile territory.\n\nWith a streamlined chassis that can handle more cargo than any other Constellation variant, the Taurus allows each run to be maximized for efficiency. However, it still provides security above many similar freighters thanks to its utilization of defensive technology developed by RSI for its more military focused ships. One Merchant Navy Taurus, the Aliwent, is a particularly welcome sight for the brave starmen serving at listening posts in Kellog, delivering supplies and much needed care packages. Itâs no wonder that many captains are eagerly waiting for the 2951 Taurus to be brought into service.\n

fleetweek2950_holoviewer_vulture_desc=Thereâs no denying it - winning can be messy business. When your fleet of Drake ships is done laying waste to the latest batch of outlaws who were foolhardy enough to tangle with you and your people, thereâs going to be no shortage of wreckage to wade through. \n\nThatâs where the Vulture comes in. No need to leave behind a veritable junkyard around your station or homestead for criminals to use as cover next time they attack; the Vulture can help you clean it all up and then some. Forget just clearing the way, salvage pays. What better way to defend yourself than to have the broken ships of your enemies pay for your next round of ammunition? Sounds like a fitting end to us.\n

hdactivist_assassination_danger_001=Don't take this target lightly. There's a reason Hurston's relied on them to do so much dirty work.Â 
hdactivist_assassination_danger_002=You're going after one vicious bastard, so best come prepared.Â 
hdactivist_assassination_danger_003=I'd recommend hitting them hard and fast before they have a chance to comm for backup.Â 
hdactivist_assassination_danger_004=Watch out for this one. 'Mercy' isn't part of their vocabulary.Â 
hdactivist_assassination_desc_001=To anyone who knows Hurston's recent history, they know that ~mission(TargetName) is responsible for some truly vicious crimes against the honest men and women who are trying to improve worker conditions on Hurston. Time and time again, they have acted well outside the bounds of UEE law but, of course, Hurston denies that ~mission(TargetName|Last) has anything to do with these crimes and refuses to even investigate them. This miscarriage of justice means that we must take matters into our own hands. \n\nRecently, an insider sympathetic to our cause says ~mission(TargetName|Last) can be found around ~mission(Location|Address). I will happily pass along this information, and a substantial payday, to anyone willing to bring vengeance upon them. ~mission(Danger)~mission(Contractor|Timed)Â \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_assassination_desc_002=Any chance you've heard of ~mission(TargetName)? Hurston recently promoted this bloodthirsty thug to a special task force that makes dissidents disappear. ~mission(TargetName|Last) has proven to be quite effective and even taken a perverse pleasure in the new position. It's obvious that the universe would be better off if ~mission(TargetName|Last) was taken down.\n\n~mission(Danger)I managed to get a hold of their latest deployment orders. You should be able to find them at ~mission(Location|Address).\n\n~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_assassination_desc_003=Let's just say the less you know about this one the better. We want you to find and eliminate a Hurston lackey named ~mission(TargetName).Â ~mission(Danger)Â \n\nDetails containing their last known sighting around ~mission(Location|Address) will be provided. ~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **

hdactivist_basesweep_danger_003=Make sure you're armed up and prepared for war.Â 
hdactivist_basesweep_danger_004=I'm not gonna lie, this will get bloody, but that's what we have to do to secure our future.Â 
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_001=Recently, Hurston security forces have been increasingly more violent to anyone voicing opposition to their authority. We've tried all legal channels, but it seems that an equally aggressive response will be the only way they'll hear us. I'm looking to pay someone to deliver that message.\n\nWe've learned that security forces have been operating out of ~mission(Location|Address). I'll send you the coordinates. You go in and clear it out.Â ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweepDanger)\n\nHopefully there will be a day where we can resolve this through rational discourse, but they've made it clear that it is not today.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_002=Looking for a heavy hitter interested in some serious action. ~mission(Location|Address) is crawling with corrupt, armed assholes working for Hurston. I need them gone, pronto. Don't care how you handle it, only that it gets done.Â ~mission(Contractor|Danger)Â \n\nDo this right and you'll be compensated accordingly.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_003=If you found this, it's probably safe to say that you have an axe to grind with Hurston. I don't know about you, but I'm sick and tired of waiting for things to magically get better. What we need are bold actions to show Hurston that the status quo must go. \n\nThat's why I dug up some info about ~mission(Location|Address). It's where corporate thugs hang out and plan their attacks on the people of Hurston. Clearing that location would send a bold message to Corporate that we're willing to fight fire with fire. You interested? \n\nIt'll be dangerous, but you'll be paid well.Â ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweepDanger)Â \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_004=We got intel on ~mission(Location|Address) that says it's staffed with corporate thugs. We aren't just going to sit around and wait for them to crack down on our brothers and sisters who are just trying to make Hurston a better place to live. I don't have the skills to handle this type of op, but I've got the creds to fund it. Interested? \n\nShould go without saying, but this job will be highly dangerous. ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweep)A lot of good people will get hurt if someone doesn't stop them.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_basesweep_desc_005=Looking for someone who's willing to fight for what's right. For far too long Hurston has used violence to keep its people in line. Now it's time to show them that their intimidation tactics won't go unanswered.\n\nI've recently obtained intel that's identified ~mission(Location|Address) as being key to their security operations. Anyone willing to clear out the location will be doing the people of Hurston a great service. It'll be risky, but I'll also make sure you're paid well for your trouble.Â ~mission(Contractor|BaseSweep)Â \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **

As you can imagine, we can't allow their greed to endanger the movement, nor can we afford to pay their unreasonable demands. \n\nInstead, we're hopeful that you'll be able to track them down for us and forcefully retrieve our rightful property. Once you successfully bring the shipment to ~mission(Destination|Address), we will gladly give you the credits we had originally promised ~mission(TargetName|Last). \n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_002=Recently, one of our much needed supply runs got hit by an outlaw. Before our hauler died, they managed to confirm the identity of their attacker - ~mission(TargetName).\n\nWe need you to hunt this bastard down and take back what's ours. And of course we'll pay you for delivering the supplies to ~mission(Destination|Address).\n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_003=~mission(TargetName) betrayed us. \n\nAn important shipment we had smuggled in to ~mission(Destination|Address) went missing a few days ago and we were finally able to track it down. One of our operatives, ~mission(TargetName|Last), had stolen it.\n\nWe need that traitor tacked down and the shipment brought back. Do whatever you need to.  \n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealfromship_outlaw_desc_004=Hurston Security is taking active action to cut off our supply routes. They're even turning a blind eye to outlaws in the area as long as it's our ships being attacked. We need to respond before our resources are completely cut off. \n\nWe've been able to track down the location of one of these outlaws, ~mission(TargetName). Bring the stolen goods aboard their ship back to ~mission(Destination|Address). I don't expect ~mission(TargetName|Last) will give it up without a fight.\n\nHopefully this'll show Hurston that we will not back down.\n\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **

hdactivist_stealitem_danger_003=Fair warning, but security might be at the site. If they come after you, do what's necessary to get that crate.Â 
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_004=As always, a gig like this can be dangerous. So plan for the worst, hope for the best, right?Â 
hdactivist_stealitem_danger_005=Be careful. Security could be all over that location.Â 
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_001=Got information on the location of a certain package that would greatly help our cause.

hdactivist_stealitem_desc_002=Want to support a good cause and earn some solid creds? \n\nIf so, then help us get our hands on specific crate that's supposed to be in ~mission(Location|Address). If you find the crate and bring it to ~mission(Destination|Address), I'll make it worth your while. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)Â \n\n~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_003=There's a growing movement focused on making Hurston a better place and we need some help. We've been tracking a certain item for some time that could help our cause in multiple ways. With Hurston's recent escalation of oppression, we believe now is the time to acquire it for ourselves, but with security forces watching our every move, we need someone else to collect it from ~mission(Location|Address). \n\nIf you bring the crate to ~mission(Destination|Address), we'll pay you a price commensurate with your troubles. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)~mission(Contractor|Timed) Â \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_004=Recently, Hurston fabricated charges against a hauler working for us in order to confiscate a very important delivery. Their actions aren't legal, even by Hurston standards, but they don't care and we can't wait attain it through legal channels. That's why I'm looking to pay someone to do it for us.\n\nAn insider who's sympathetic to our cause claims it ended up in ~mission(Location|Address). I'll send you the exact coordinates. ~mission(Contractor|Timed)Â \n\nOnce you have the crate, bring it to ~mission(Destination|Address) and I'll transfer the creds. ~mission(Contractor|Danger) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_005=The Lorville customs office claims to have lost a crate that was being sent to us by a prominent supporter outside the system. I've got it on good authority that's a lie. Those Hurston bastards simply seized it to mess with us. I can't let this injustice stand and hope you're willing to help right this wrong.\n\nI just got word that they moved the crate to ~mission(Location|Address). I need someone to find this thing and bring it to ~mission(Destination|Address). ~mission(Contractor|Timed)~mission(Contractor|Danger)I'll make sure you're paid well for all your trouble.\n\n** Ex Malo Bonum **
hdactivist_stealitem_desc_006=I need your help. An old friend was desperate for work, so I threw him a gig hauling a valuable item for us. Turns out he had an active crime stat, and Hurston Security arrested him before he could make the delivery. Now I'm in hot water. That crate needs to get to ~mission(Destination|Address) or I'm screwed.\n\nI pulled a few strings and discovered that the cargo actually ended up in ~mission(Location|Address). I'll pay you if you can retrieve it for me and make the delivery. ~mission(Contractor|Danger)~mission(Contractor|Timed) \n\n** Ex Malo Bonum**

Livingston\nRISK ASSESSMENT: High\nRUSH CONTRACT: Yes\n\nHurston has learned that the Nine Tails are attacking ~mission(Location|address). Our on-site forces have suffered heavy casualties and stopped responding to comms. Initial reports indicated that the gang was attempting to obtain confidential material recently delivered to the facility. Thankfully, we have security measures in place that should give us time to respond. We need an operative to head to the facility immediately, retrieve those boxes, and deliver them to a secure location.\n\nYou and whatever backup you choose to bring are authorized to take any actions necessary when confronting the trespassers. Suspects are considered armed and dangerous. Hurston will not provide material support and/or updates regarding the status of the facility's security forces. \n\nThe confidential materials were discreetly delivered alongside other boxes in a consignment and locked in our automated vault. The retrieval codes needed to access them are kept on datapads held by senior security staff. Find those datapads and then enter the consignment codes at the package conveyor to retrieve the boxes. Payment will be sent once all confidential materials have been delivered to ~mission(dropoff1|address). \n\n\n** The information transmitted may contain confidential and/or privileged material. Any review, retransmission, dissemination, or other use of or taking action in reliance upon this information by persons or entities other than the intended recipient is prohibited. **
